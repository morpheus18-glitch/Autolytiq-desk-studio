### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL TRADE-IN CREDIT** (trade-in value is NOT taxable)

**Treatment:** Wisconsin allows a full trade-in allowance credit where the sale of a motor vehicle minus any trade-in allowance is subject to tax, if the sale and trade-in are one transaction.

**How It Works:**
- The purchase price subject to tax = Selling price - Trade-in value
- Buyer saves sales tax on the full value of the trade-in
- The trade-in credit only applies when the sale and trade-in are part of one transaction
- A separate or independent sale of a motor vehicle is not a trade-in, even if proceeds are immediately applied to a purchase

**Example:**
If a dealer sells two motor vehicles for $10,000 and $12,000 and accepts a trade-in valued at $15,000, the sales price subject to sales tax is $7,000 (the $22,000 selling price less the $15,000 trade-in).

**Tax Savings Example:**
- Vehicle price: $30,000
- Trade-in value: $10,000
- Taxable amount: $20,000
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,100 (instead of $1,650 without trade-in)
- **Savings: $550**

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE** (manufacturer rebates do NOT reduce taxable sales price)

**Rule:** A manufacturer's rebate to a person who purchases tangible personal property from a retailer is NOT a reduction of the retailer's sales price for sales or use tax purposes.

**How It Works:**
- Sales tax is calculated on the full purchase price BEFORE manufacturer rebates
- The customer pays tax on the higher amount even though they receive a rebate
- This differs from dealer discounts, which DO reduce the taxable amount

**Example:**
- Vehicle price: $25,000
- Manufacturer rebate: $2,500
- Out-of-pocket cost to buyer: $22,500
- **Taxable amount: $25,000** (rebate does NOT reduce tax base)
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,375

**Source:** Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.28(3)(c)2, Wisconsin DOR Publication 202, Sales Tax Handbook

---

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate/Discount Treatment

**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE** (dealer discounts/rebates reduce taxable sales price)

**Rule:** Cash discounts, price reductions for dealer coupons, and dealer rebates allowed by a dealer directly to customers reduce the dealer's receipts subject to tax.

**Manufacturer Wholesale Incentives:**
- If the manufacturer gives a wholesale incentive to the dealer, the dealer may or may not pass it along
- If the dealer passes a portion to the customer as a price reduction, the dealer's taxable receipts are reduced by that amount

**Key Distinction:**
- **Manufacturer-to-customer rebates:** Taxable (see 1.3 above)
- **Dealer-to-customer discounts/rebates:** Not taxable (reduces tax base)
- **Manufacturer-to-dealer incentives passed through:** Not taxable to the extent passed to customer

**Source:** Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.28(3)(c)2, Wisconsin DOR guidance

### 1.5 Documentary Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

**Taxability:** **TAXABLE** (with one exception)

**Cap Amount:** **NO CAP** (dealers can set their own fees)

**Typical Range:** $295 to $500
**Average:** $299

**Tax Treatment:**
- **TAXABLE:** Service fees charged for completing Wisconsin Buyer's Guide, inspecting titles, disclosing lemon law notices, checking recalls, and other administrative work
- **TAXABLE:** Charges for delivery, handling, and preparation of motor vehicle
- **TAXABLE:** Service fees for completing sales-related or lease-related vehicle inspection or forms required by law
- **NOT TAXABLE:** Dealer service fees ONLY for electronically filing the purchaser's registration and titling application with Wisconsin DOT

**Example:**
- Vehicle price: $25,000
- Doc fee: $399
- Trade-in: -$5,000
- **Taxable amount: $20,399** (doc fee is included)
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,121.95

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- Dealers must disclose service fees to buyers
- Fee must be posted on the vehicle
- Fee should be visible on the vehicle purchase contract
- Wisconsin allows dealers to set their own service fees with no state cap

### 1.6 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE**

**Rule:** Extended warranties or service contracts are subject to Wisconsin sales or use tax even though referred to as "insurance," and even though separately stated, if the motor vehicle to which the warranty relates is subject to Wisconsin sales or use tax.

**Details:**
- Wisconsin sales tax is imposed on the sale of contracts, including service contracts, maintenance agreements, and warranties
- Applies to contracts that provide for future performance of or payment for repair, service, alteration, fitting, cleaning, painting, coating, towing, inspection, or maintenance of tangible personal property
- Exception: Underlying property sale must be taxable (if property is exempt, service contract is also exempt)
- Even if the service contract charge is separately stated on the invoice, it remains taxable

**Example:**
- Vehicle price: $25,000
- VSC (extended warranty): $2,500
- **Taxable amount: $27,500**
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,512.50

**Source:** Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.27(3), Wisconsin Statute 77.52(2)(a), Wisconsin DOR Publication 202

---

### 1.7 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE** (when separately stated)

**Rule:** Insurance charges, including credit life and accident, casualty, theft, loss, and GAP insurance, are exempt from Wisconsin sales or use tax when separately stated on the invoice provided to the purchaser.

**Requirements:**
- GAP insurance charges must be **separately stated** on the invoice
- Cannot be bundled with other charges
- Must comply with Wisconsin Statute 77.54(8)

**Example:**
- Vehicle price: $25,000
- GAP insurance: $795 (separately stated)
- **Taxable amount: $25,000** (GAP not included)
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,375.00
- Total with GAP: $27,170.00

**If NOT Separately Stated:**
- The GAP charge becomes part of the taxable sales price
- Buyer pays tax on the GAP charge

**Source:** Wisconsin Statute 77.54(8), Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.27(4)(b), Wisconsin DOR Publication 202

---

### 1.8 Accessories Taxability

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE**

**Rule:** The sale of parts, accessories, and attachments for motor vehicles is subject to Wisconsin sales or use tax.

**Details:**
- Factory-installed accessories: Taxable
- Dealer-installed accessories: Taxable
- Aftermarket accessories sold with vehicle: Taxable
- Equipment sold with motor vehicle: Taxable

**Specific Items (All Taxable):**
- Undercoating and rustproofing
- Paint protection and interior protection
- Environmental protection products
- Audio/navigation systems
- Roof racks, running boards, tow hitches
- Bed liners, tonneau covers
- Remote starters, alarm systems
- Window tinting
- All other parts, accessories, and attachments

**Example:**
- Vehicle price: $25,000
- Bed liner: $500
- Running boards: $800
- **Taxable amount: $26,300**
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,446.50

**Source:** Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.83(8)(b), Wisconsin DOR Publication 202, Sales Tax Handbook

---

### 1.9 Negative Equity Taxability

**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE**

**Rule:** Negative equity that is rolled into the financing for a new vehicle does NOT increase the taxable sales price of the new car. Tax is based only on the negotiated price of the vehicle itself.

**How It Works:**
- Wisconsin taxes the actual selling price of the new vehicle
- The amount of negative equity rolled into the loan is not added to the taxable base
- Only if negative equity exceeds trade-in value does it affect financing (not taxation)

**Example:**
- New vehicle price: $30,000
- Trade-in value: $10,000
- Payoff on trade-in: $15,000
- Negative equity: $5,000 (rolled into new loan)
- **Taxable amount: $20,000** ($30,000 - $10,000 trade-in)
- Tax at 5.5%: $1,100
- Amount financed: $25,000 ($20,000 + $5,000 negative equity + $1,100 tax)

**Key Point:** The $5,000 negative equity increases the loan amount but does NOT increase the taxable sales price.

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD** (with upfront cap reduction also taxed)

**Rule:** Wisconsin taxes both:
1. Each monthly lease payment as it's made
2. Any upfront capitalized cost reduction (down payment) at lease inception

**Tax is NOT applied to:**
- Interest/financing charges (if separately stated)
- Residual value
- Depreciation alone (only the monthly payment is taxed)

**Payment Components Taxed:**
- Monthly base payment: **Taxable**
- Capitalized cost reduction (cash down payment): **Taxable**
- Trade-in as cap cost reduction: **Taxable** (but see 2.3 below)
- Service contracts added to payment: **Taxable**
- Doc fees: **Taxable**
- Accessories: **Taxable**

**Not Taxed:**
- GAP insurance (if separately stated): **Not taxable**
- Other insurance (if separately stated): **Not taxable**

**Source:** Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.84(1)(e), Wisconsin DOR Publication 202

---

### 2.2 Capitalized Cost Reduction (Cap Cost Reduction) Treatment

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE** (cash cap cost reductions do NOT reduce the taxable amount)

**Rule:** Capitalized cost reductions made in cash do not reduce the amount subject to Wisconsin sales or use tax.

**Definition:** "Capitalized cost reduction" means the sum, at lease inception, of:
- Any payments made by cash, check, rebates, or the like that constitute a down payment by the lessee
- The net amount credited by the lessor for any trade-in

**Wisconsin's Unique Approach:**
Unlike some states where a cap cost reduction might reduce the tax base, Wisconsin taxes:
- The full cap cost reduction upfront (at lease inception)
- Each monthly payment in full

**Example from Wisconsin DOR:**
- Lease term: 36 months
- Monthly payment: $350/month (due at beginning of each period)
- One-time cash cap cost reduction: $2,000 at signing
- **Taxable at inception:** $2,000 + $350 = $2,350
- **Taxable each subsequent month:** $350
- **Total tax paid over 36 months:** Tax on [$2,000 + (36 × $350)] = Tax on $14,600

**At 5.5% tax rate:**
- Tax at inception: $129.25 (on $2,350)
- Tax each of next 35 months: $19.25 (on $350)
- **Total tax over lease: $802.75**

**Source:** Wisconsin Admin Code Tax 11.84(1)(e), Wisconsin DOR Publication 202, Chapter 429 Wisconsin Statutes

---

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE AS CAP COST REDUCTION**

**Rule:** When a trade-in is used as part of a lease transaction, it is treated as a capitalized cost reduction. The value of the trade-in is included in the gross capitalized cost calculation and is taxed upfront.

**How It Differs from Purchase:**
- **On a purchase:** Trade-in value reduces taxable sales price (NOT taxed)
- **On a lease:** Trade-in value is treated as a cap cost reduction (IS taxed upfront)

**Definition:** Per Wisconsin Chapter 429, "capitalized cost reduction" includes "the net amount credited by the lessor for any trade-in."

**Example:**
- Gross cap cost: $30,000
- Trade-in value: $5,000 (applied as cap cost reduction)
- Cash down: $2,000
- Total cap cost reduction: $7,000
- Adjusted cap cost: $23,000
- **Taxable at inception:** $7,000 (both trade-in and cash down)
- Tax at 5.5%: $385
- Plus tax on first monthly payment

**Important Note:** This is a significant difference from purchase transactions and should be clearly disclosed to customers considering lease vs. purchase.

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Service Contracts (VSC) and Extended Warranties:**
**Treatment:** **TAXABLE**

- Service contract charges, warranty charges, and maintenance agreement charges are included in the sales price for leases
- If included in monthly payment: Taxed each month
- If paid upfront: Taxed at lease inception
- Cannot be excluded from tax base even if separately stated

**Example:**
- Monthly payment: $350
- VSC included in payment: $50/month
- Total monthly payment: $400
- **Taxable monthly:** $400
- Tax at 5.5%: $22.00/month

**GAP Insurance:**
**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE** (if separately stated)

- GAP insurance can be deducted from taxable lease receipts
- Must meet Wisconsin Statute 77.54(8) requirements
- Must be separately stated on invoice/lease agreement
- If bundled into payment without separate disclosure: Becomes taxable

**Example:**
- Monthly payment: $350
- GAP insurance: $25/month (separately stated)
- **Taxable monthly:** $350
- Tax at 5.5%: $19.25/month
- Total monthly charge: $394.25

### 2.5 Doc Fee Treatment on Leases

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE** (same as purchases)

**Rule:** Service fees charged for lease-related vehicle inspection or forms required by law are included in the taxable lease amount.

**Exception:** Dealer service fees specifically for electronically filing the lessee's registration and titling application with Wisconsin DOT are NOT taxable.

**Typical Treatment:**
- Doc fee added to capitalized cost: Taxed upfront
- Doc fee added to monthly payment: Taxed monthly
- Most commonly: Added to cap cost and taxed at inception

**Example:**
- Gross cap cost: $30,000
- Doc fee: $399
- Adjusted gross cap cost: $30,399
- Cap cost reduction: $3,000
- **Taxable at inception:** $3,000 (cap cost reduction)
- Adjusted cap cost for monthly payment calculation: $27,399
- Tax on cap cost reduction at 5.5%: $165

## 3. RECIPROCITY

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** **YES** - Wisconsin provides credit for taxes paid to other states on vehicle purchases

**Rule:** Wisconsin state, county, and city use tax due may be offset by tax properly paid in another state. The buyer is liable for Wisconsin use tax as of the time the property is used in a taxable manner in Wisconsin, subject to a credit for sales or use tax properly paid to another state.

**How It Works:**
1. If you purchase a vehicle in another state and pay sales tax there
2. When you bring the vehicle to Wisconsin and register it
3. Wisconsin will impose use tax on the purchase
4. You receive a credit for the amount of tax paid to the other state
5. You only pay the difference (if Wisconsin rate is higher)

**Example 1 - Credit Eliminates Wisconsin Tax:**
- Vehicle purchased in Illinois for $25,000
- Illinois sales tax paid (6.25%): $1,562.50
- Wisconsin tax rate (5.5%): $1,375.00
- Credit for Illinois tax: $1,375.00
- **Additional Wisconsin tax due: $0** (Illinois tax exceeds WI tax)

**Example 2 - Partial Credit:**
- Vehicle purchased in state with 4% tax for $25,000
- Other state sales tax paid (4%): $1,000
- Wisconsin tax rate (5.5%): $1,375.00
- Credit for other state tax: $1,000
- **Additional Wisconsin tax due: $375.00**

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of sales tax paid to other state
- Original sales receipt or invoice
- Title documentation

---

### 3.2 Reciprocity Agreements (Income Tax Context)

**Note:** Wisconsin has reciprocity agreements with Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Michigan, but these apply to **income tax only** and do not affect vehicle sales tax treatment.

**Income Tax Reciprocity Does NOT Apply To:**
- Vehicle sales or use tax
- Property tax
- Sales tax on any goods
- Lottery winnings
- Self-employment income

**Vehicle Tax Reciprocity:**
Wisconsin does not have special reciprocity agreements for vehicle taxation, but does provide the credit system described in 3.1 above for all states.

### 4.3 Special Schemes and Unusual Rules

#### 4.3.1 Occasional Sale Exemption (Limited for Vehicles)

### 7.3 Out-of-State Purchase Example

**Scenario:**
- Wisconsin resident purchases vehicle in Illinois
- Purchase price: $28,000
- Illinois tax paid (6.25%): $1,750
- Wisconsin tax rate (5.5%): Would be $1,540
- Credit for Illinois tax: $1,540

**Calculation:**
```
Vehicle price:              $28,000
Illinois tax paid:          $1,750 (6.25%)

Wisconsin use tax due:      $1,540 (5.5%)
Credit for IL tax:          -$1,540
Additional WI tax due:      $0

Total tax paid:             $1,750 (to Illinois only)
```

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR AUTOLYTIQ SYSTEM

### 8.1 Required System Configuration

**Tax Rate Setup:**
- Base state rate: 5.0%
- County rates: Configurable by county (0.0%, 0.5%, or 0.9%)
- City rates: Additional rates for specific municipalities
- Default combined rate: 5.5% (most common)
- Milwaukee County rate: 5.9%

**Tax Calculation Rules:**
1. **Retail Sales:**
   - Include: Vehicle price, accessories, doc fee, VSC
   - Exclude: Trade-in value, dealer discounts, GAP (if separate), manufacturer rebates (include in price)

2. **Leases:**
   - Tax cap cost reduction upfront
   - Tax monthly payments
   - Include VSC in taxable amount
   - Exclude GAP if separately stated

### 8.2 User Interface Considerations

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- Clearly show trade-in advantage on sales vs. leases
- Highlight that manufacturer rebates are taxed
- Show GAP must be separately stated to be non-taxable
- Display county-specific tax rates
- Calculate and display wheel tax when applicable

**Calculator Features:**
- Trade-in credit toggle
- Separate line items for rebates vs. discounts
- GAP insurance separate disclosure option
- County selection for accurate rate
- Lease vs. purchase tax comparison

### 8.3 Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Trade-in with negative equity on lease:** Entire trade-in value (even with payoff) is taxed as cap reduction
2. **Doc fee on electronic filing:** Exclude only the electronic filing portion
3. **Bundled products:** Default to taxable unless separately stated
4. **Out-of-state credits:** Require documentation, apply lesser of taxes paid vs. WI tax due
5. **Occasional sales:** Family transfers may be exempt (requires documentation)
