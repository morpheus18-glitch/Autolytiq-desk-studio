---

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Status:** ✅ **FULL TRADE-IN CREDIT (UNLIMITED)**

Louisiana provides a **full, unlimited** trade-in credit. The value of your trade-in vehicle is **not subject to sales tax**. The trade-in value is deducted from the purchase price of the new vehicle before calculating sales tax.

**Example:**
- New vehicle price: $20,000
- Trade-in value: $7,000
- **Taxable amount:** $13,000
- Sales tax (at 9%): $1,170

**Application:**
- Applies to both state and local taxes
- No cap or limit on trade-in value
- Trade-in must be applied at time of purchase
- Works for both new and used vehicle purchases

**Negative Equity Treatment:**
- Negative equity (underwater trade-ins) can be rolled into the new loan
- The unpaid balance from the trade-in is added to the amount financed
- Negative equity is **NOT taxable** (it's debt, not part of the purchase price)

**Source:** Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Tax Publication (LDR 20164); Car and Driver Louisiana Sales Tax Guide (2025)

---

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Status:** ✅ **NOT TAXABLE**

Manufacturer rebates, incentives, and factory cash-back offers are **NOT taxable** in Louisiana. Sales tax is calculated **after** the rebate is applied to the purchase price.

**Example:**
- New vehicle MSRP: $46,000
- Manufacturer rebate: $4,000
- **Taxable amount:** $42,000
- Sales tax (at 9%): $3,780

**Types of Non-Taxable Manufacturer Incentives:**
- Factory rebates
- Factory-to-dealer cash incentives passed to buyer
- Manufacturer loyalty bonuses
- Manufacturer conquest incentives
- Special financing incentives

---

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Status:** ✅ **NOT TAXABLE**

Dealer rebates, discounts, and incentives are **NOT taxable** in Louisiana. Like manufacturer rebates, dealer incentives reduce the taxable purchase price.

**Covered Items:**
- Dealer discounts
- Dealer cash incentives
- Dealer-sponsored rebates
- Negotiated price reductions

**Tax Calculation:**
Sales tax is calculated on the **net selling price** after all rebates, incentives, and discounts are applied.

**Source:** Louisiana Sales Tax Handbook; Private Auto Louisiana Sales Tax Guide (2025)

### 1.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee)

**Taxability:** ⚠️ **LIKELY TAXABLE** (as part of cash price)

**Maximum Cap:** **$425** (per Louisiana RS 6:969.18)

**Legal Framework:**
Louisiana Revised Statute 6:969.18 allows sellers to charge:
- Up to **$35** for documentation fee for services performed in documenting a motor vehicle credit transaction (by credit extender)
- Up to **$425** maximum for seller documentation and compliance fee

**What Doc Fees Cover:**
- Credit investigation
- Compliance with federal and state law
- Preparation of documents to perfect or satisfy a lien
- Titling functions
- Other functions incidental to the sale

**Additional Convenience Charge:**
Dealers may collect a **separate convenience charge** for services performed in obtaining a motor vehicle license or title on the consumer's behalf.

**Tax Treatment:**
The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles documentation indicates that "Sales/Use tax will be assessed on the sale price of the vehicle, in addition to the applicable, taxable items listed on the dealer invoice or bill of sale." This suggests doc fees shown on the invoice are likely included in the taxable base.

**Source:** Louisiana RS 6:969.18; Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles Publication

**Note:** Some sources list Louisiana's doc fee cap at $200, but the current statute (RS 6:969.18) specifies $425. Verify with Louisiana Department of Revenue for current enforcement.

### 1.6 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Status:** ⚠️ **UNCLEAR - LIKELY EXEMPT (IF REGULATED AS INSURANCE)**

Louisiana regulates vehicle service contracts (VSCs) and extended warranties as **insurance products** under state insurance law. Automotive service contract companies in Louisiana are considered "Vehicle Mechanical Breakdown Insurers" and must be licensed by the Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance.

**Key Findings:**

**Regulatory Framework:**
- VSCs are regulated as insurance, not tangible personal property
- Louisiana generally does NOT tax insurance premiums
- Louisiana sales tax applies to tangible personal property and certain enumerated services

**Finance Act Reference:**
Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (RS Title 6, Chapter 10-B) allows "insurance premiums, extended warranty, service contract, and similar fees" to be included in the **cash price** for financing purposes. This suggests they can be financed but does NOT definitively state they are taxable.

**General Louisiana Tax Principle:**
Louisiana law states: "In the case of service transactions, only the particular transactions enumerated in the law are taxable." Services are generally exempt unless specifically listed as taxable.

**2025 Legislative Changes:**
Louisiana's 2025 sales tax legislation addressed various exemptions including service-related transactions, but did not explicitly list vehicle service contracts as taxable.

**Conclusion:**
Based on available evidence, vehicle service contracts are **likely exempt** from sales tax in Louisiana because:
1. They are regulated as insurance products
2. Insurance premiums are generally not subject to sales tax
3. Services are only taxable if specifically enumerated
4. No specific statute or regulation found making VSCs taxable

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at **855-307-3893** or email **sales.inquiries@la.gov** for definitive guidance.

**Source:** Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (RS 6:969 et seq.); Louisiana Insurance Code; Louisiana Sales Tax Legislation (2025)

### 1.7 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Status:** ⚠️ **UNCLEAR - LIKELY EXEMPT (AS INSURANCE PRODUCT)**

GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) coverage in Louisiana is regulated under Louisiana Revised Statute **6:969.51**, which requires sellers and lenders to offer GAP coverage to consumers as an **optional purchase**.

**Key Findings:**

**Regulatory Framework:**
- GAP is regulated as an insurance-type product
- Louisiana law requires dealerships to **offer** GAP to qualified customers (but purchase is optional)
- GAP cost may be **financed** under the transaction and made subject to loan finance charges

**Insurance Classification:**
GAP coverage is designed to protect consumers from liability when property insurance is insufficient to pay the unpaid balance after a total loss. This is fundamentally an **insurance function**.

**Tax Treatment:**
- Insurance premiums are generally **exempt** from Louisiana sales tax
- GAP is listed alongside "insurance premiums" in the Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act
- No specific statute or revenue ruling found that makes GAP taxable

**Conclusion:**
GAP insurance is **likely exempt** from Louisiana sales tax because:
1. It functions as insurance coverage
2. Louisiana does not generally tax insurance premiums
3. It is regulated separately from tangible personal property sales
4. No statutory provision found making it taxable

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at **855-307-3893** or email **sales.inquiries@la.gov** for definitive guidance, especially if GAP is offered as a "waiver" rather than insurance.

### 1.8 Accessories Taxability

**Status:** ✅ **TAXABLE**

Vehicle accessories are **taxable** as tangible personal property in Louisiana.

**Rule:**
Sales/use tax is assessed on:
1. The sale price of the vehicle, **AND**
2. The applicable, taxable items listed on the dealer invoice or bill of sale

**Taxable Accessories Include:**
- Aftermarket accessories installed by dealer
- Dealer-installed options not part of manufacturer configuration
- Add-on equipment (running boards, tonneau covers, roof racks, etc.)
- Aftermarket wheels and tires
- Electronics (stereos, navigation, security systems)
- Paint protection, fabric protection, window tinting
- Floor mats, cargo liners, splash guards

**Factory-Installed Options:**
Options installed by the manufacturer as part of the vehicle's factory build are included in the vehicle's sale price and are taxed as part of the vehicle.

**Tax Rate:**
Accessories are taxed at the **same combined state and local rate** as the vehicle itself (5% state + local parish/municipal taxes).

**Source:** Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles Publication; Louisiana RS 47:302 (General Sales Tax)

---

### 1.9 Negative Equity Taxability

**Status:** ✅ **NOT TAXABLE**

Negative equity (amount owed on trade-in exceeding its value) is **NOT subject to sales tax** in Louisiana.

**How It Works:**

**Scenario: Underwater Trade-In**
- New vehicle price: $30,000
- Trade-in value: $8,000
- Trade-in payoff: $12,000
- **Negative equity:** $4,000

**Tax Calculation:**
- Purchase price: $30,000
- Less trade-in value: -$8,000
- **Taxable amount:** $22,000
- Sales tax (at 9%): $1,980

**Financing:**
- Amount financed = $30,000 - $8,000 + $4,000 = $26,000
- The $4,000 negative equity is added to the loan but is NOT taxed

**Legal Framework:**
Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act explicitly recognizes "negative equity trade-in allowances" as part of the "amount financed" in the principal balance subject to finance charges. This is **debt**, not a purchase of taxable property.

**Industry Data (2025):**
- 26.6% of trade-ins had negative equity in Q2 2025 (4-year high)
- Average negative equity: $6,754

**Source:** Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (RS Title 6, Chapter 10-B); Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Negative Equity Report (2024)

---

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** ✅ **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAX**

Louisiana taxes vehicle leases based on the **monthly payment** amount, **not** on the total capitalized cost upfront.

**Legal Framework:**

**Louisiana RS 47:321(B) - Lease Tax**
Levies tax at the rate of **one percent (1%)** of the monthly lease or rental price paid by a lessee, or contracted or agreed to be paid by a lessee to the owner of the tangible personal property.

**Louisiana RS 47:321.1 - Additional Lease Tax**
Levies an additional tax at the rate of **0.45%** (forty-five hundredths of one percent) using the same calculation methodology.

**Combined Lease Tax Rates:**
- State lease tax: **1.0%**
- Additional state lease tax: **0.45%**
- **Total state lease tax:** 1.45%
- **Plus local parish/municipal taxes** (varies by domicile)

**What Is Taxed:**
The tax is calculated on the **monthly or periodic lease payment** that the lessee pays to the lessor. This includes:
- Depreciation component
- Finance/rent charge component
- Any other charges included in the periodic payment

**Transportation Trust Fund:**
Louisiana RS 48:77 dedicates the sales tax collections from motor vehicle leases or rentals to the **Transportation Trust Fund**.

**Reporting Requirement:**
Louisiana Department of Revenue Emergency Rule LAC 61:III.1511 requires dealers that collect sales tax on motor vehicle leases or rentals to file electronically using **Form R-1029E** (Electronic Sales Tax Return).

### 2.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Status:** ⚠️ **UNCLEAR - LIKELY TAXABLE AT SIGNING**

Louisiana law does not explicitly address whether **capitalized cost reductions** (cap cost reductions) on vehicle leases are subject to tax at signing.

**What Is Cap Cost Reduction:**
A capitalized cost reduction is the sum of:
- Cash down payment
- Trade-in allowance
- Rebates
These amounts are subtracted from the gross capitalized cost, resulting in the adjusted capitalized cost.

**Louisiana Legal Definition:**
Louisiana RS 9:3306 defines capitalized cost reduction as "any payment or payments made by the lessee at the inception of the lease to reduce the capitalized cost of the leased equipment and therefore to reduce the amount of rental payments."

**General State Practice:**
In **most states**, when you make a down payment (cap cost reduction) on an auto lease, you are charged state and local sales tax on the down payment amount **at signing**.

**Louisiana-Specific Guidance:**
The search results did not reveal specific Louisiana Department of Revenue guidance or statutes explicitly stating whether cap cost reductions are taxed upfront.

**Likely Treatment:**
Given that:
1. Louisiana taxes monthly lease payments
2. Most states tax upfront cap cost reductions
3. Louisiana taxes tangible personal property transfers

It is **likely** that cash cap cost reductions are taxed at signing, but this should be verified.

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at **855-307-3893** or email **sales.inquiries@la.gov** for definitive guidance on cap cost reduction taxation.

**Source:** Louisiana RS 9:3306; Federal Reserve Board Vehicle Leasing Guide

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Status:** ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**

Louisiana law provides a **full trade-in credit** for vehicle **purchases**, but the application of trade-in credits to vehicle **leases** is not explicitly addressed in available sources.

**Purchase Trade-In Credit:**
On purchases, Louisiana allows the full trade-in value to be deducted from the purchase price before calculating sales tax (both state and local).

**Lease Trade-In Application:**
When a trade-in is used on a lease, it typically serves as a **capitalized cost reduction**. The trade-in value is applied to reduce the gross capitalized cost.

**Unanswered Questions:**
1. Does Louisiana allow trade-in value to reduce the taxable cap cost reduction at signing?
2. Does the trade-in value reduce the monthly payment tax base?
3. Is the treatment the same for state lease tax and local lease tax?

**Comparison to Other States:**
Many states that offer trade-in credits on purchases also extend the benefit to leases, either by:
- Exempting the trade-in value from upfront taxation, or
- Reducing the amount subject to monthly payment tax

However, treatment varies significantly by state.

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at **855-307-3893** or email **sales.inquiries@la.gov** to confirm whether trade-in credits apply to lease transactions and, if so, how they are applied.

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability (VSC, GAP) on Leases

**Status:** ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**

The taxability of backend products (Vehicle Service Contracts, GAP insurance) on **lease** transactions is not explicitly addressed in available Louisiana sources.

**On Purchases:**
As discussed in Sections 1.6 and 1.7, VSCs and GAP are **likely exempt** from sales tax on purchases because they are regulated as insurance products.

**On Leases:**
Questions include:
1. If VSC or GAP is added to a lease, is it taxed as part of the monthly payment?
2. Is there an upfront tax on the full VSC/GAP premium at lease signing?
3. Are these products treated differently on leases vs. purchases?

**General Lease Taxation Principle:**
Louisiana taxes the **monthly lease payment**. If backend products are included in the monthly payment calculation, they would be subject to the lease tax. If purchased separately, different rules may apply.

**Lack of Specific Guidance:**
No Louisiana Department of Revenue revenue rulings, regulations, or statutes were found that specifically address backend products on leases.

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at **855-307-3893** or email **sales.inquiries@la.gov** for guidance on taxing backend products in lease transactions.

**Source:** Louisiana Motor Vehicle Lease and Rental Tax guidance (Louisiana Department of Revenue)

---

### 2.5 Doc Fee Treatment on Leases

**Status:** ⚠️ **LIKELY TAXABLE (IF INCLUDED IN MONTHLY PAYMENT)**

Louisiana allows dealers to charge documentation fees on lease transactions, subject to the same statutory cap as purchases (**$425** per RS 6:969.18).

**Likely Treatment:**
If the doc fee is:
- **Included in the capitalized cost** → Likely taxed as part of monthly payments
- **Charged as a separate upfront fee** → Likely subject to upfront tax

**Statutory Cap:**
The **$425 maximum** for seller documentation and compliance fees applies to both purchase and lease transactions.

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at **855-307-3893** or email **sales.inquiries@la.gov** for definitive guidance on doc fee taxation in lease transactions.

**Source:** Louisiana RS 6:969.18

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Status:** ✅ **YES - RECIPROCAL CREDIT WITH RATE-TO-RATE BASIS**

Louisiana **grants a credit** against its sales tax to residents who paid a similar tax on the purchase of a motor vehicle in another state, **IF** that state allows a credit for taxes paid in Louisiana.

**Key Rules:**

**Reciprocity Requirement:**
The other state must offer a similar credit to Louisiana residents. This is a **reciprocal** system.

**Credit Scope:**
- Credit is granted on a **rate-to-rate basis**, not dollar-to-dollar
- The credit applies to the **state tax only** (5%), not to parish and municipality taxes
- Applicants are allowed credit for the **full rate** of sales or use tax paid in the other state

**Application:**
The credit applies when:
1. A Louisiana resident purchases a vehicle in another state
2. The resident paid sales tax to that other state
3. The other state offers reciprocal credit to Louisiana residents
4. The vehicle is titled or registered in Louisiana

**Example:**
- Louisiana resident buys car in Texas and pays 6.25% Texas sales tax
- If Texas offers reciprocal credit to Louisiana residents, the buyer receives credit for the full Texas tax against Louisiana's 5% state tax
- Buyer would still owe Louisiana **local taxes** (parish/municipal)

**Military Exception:**
Military personnel are **exempt** from payment of use tax on motor vehicles imported into Louisiana while on active duty, providing they have proof that sales tax was previously paid on their vehicle in one of the 50 states.

**Source:** Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Tax Publication; Louisiana RS 47:337.86 (Credit for taxes paid)

### 3.2 Special Rules or Limitations

**New Resident Cap (Effective January 1, 2025):**

For qualifying vehicles registered on or after **January 1, 2025**, the use tax owed on a motor vehicle registered by a new resident of Louisiana **cannot exceed $90**.

**Requirements to Qualify for $90 Cap:**
All of the following conditions must be met:
1. The vehicle is primarily used for **personal purposes**
2. The vehicle was previously registered in the name of the new resident in any other state OR was previously leased to the new resident in another state
3. The vehicle is registered **within 90 days** of being brought into Louisiana

**Credit Interaction:**
If the credits granted for taxes paid in another state reduce the use tax to **less than $90**, the taxpayer owes that lower amount.

**Fair Market Value Basis:**
A use tax is due on the **fair market value** of a motor vehicle brought into Louisiana by a new resident who previously registered the vehicle in another state or a foreign country.

**Payment Deadline:**
Use tax is payable by the **30th day following the month** the vehicle first enters Louisiana.

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 First Use Tax vs. Sales Tax

**System:** Louisiana operates both a **sales tax** and a **use tax** system.

**Sales Tax:**
Applied to purchases made **within Louisiana** at the point of sale.

**Use Tax:**
Applied to:
1. Purchases made **out-of-state** and brought into Louisiana
2. Vehicles brought into Louisiana by **new residents**
3. Vehicles on which no sales tax was paid

**Rate:**
The use tax rate is the **same as the sales tax rate**:
- State: **5.0%** (as of January 1, 2025)
- Plus applicable **local parish/municipal taxes**

**Basis:**
Use tax is calculated on the **fair market value** of the vehicle (not necessarily the original purchase price).

**New Resident Cap:**
As of January 1, 2025, qualified new residents pay a **maximum of $90** in use tax if conditions are met (see Section 3.2).

**Source:** Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 25-011 (2025); Louisiana RS 47:302 (Sales Tax) and RS 47:321 (Use Tax)

---

### 4.2 Special Schemes or Unusual Rules

**1. Domicile-Based Taxation:**
Unlike most states, Louisiana bases the tax rate on the **domicile of the purchaser**, not the location of the seller. This means a buyer pays the tax rate of their home parish, regardless of where they purchase the vehicle.

**2. Lease Tax Dedication to Transportation Trust Fund:**
Sales tax collections from motor vehicle leases/rentals are dedicated to the **Transportation Trust Fund** (RS 48:77), earmarking these funds for transportation infrastructure.

**3. Separate Lease Tax Rates:**
Louisiana has **different tax rates** for purchases vs. leases:
- Purchase: 5% state + local
- Lease: 1.45% state + local (on monthly payments)

**4. Electronic Filing Requirement for Leases:**
Dealers that collect sales tax on motor vehicle leases or rentals **must file electronically** using Form R-1029E (Emergency Rule LAC 61:III.1511).

**5. Orthopedic Disability Rebate Program:**
Louisiana offers a **sales tax rebate** to purchasers of motor vehicles used by persons with orthopedic disabilities (RS 47:305.72). The purchaser pays tax at time of sale, then applies for a rebate.

**6. Antique Vehicle Exemption:**
As of July 1, 2019, antique cars are **exempt** from Louisiana local and state vehicle sales taxes if:
- The vehicle was made **more than 25 years ago**
- The vehicle is valued at **more than $10,000**
- The vehicle is **not used in a commercial capacity**

**7. Peer-to-Peer Vehicle Sharing Platform Rules:**
Louisiana law requires dealers operating a **peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform** to file sales tax returns electronically using Form R-1029E.

**Source:** Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 47; Louisiana Department of Revenue Emergency Rules; Louisiana Sales Tax Handbook (2025)

---

### 4.3 Parish Differences

**Local Tax Rates:**
Each Louisiana parish and municipality may impose its own local sales tax on vehicle purchases. These rates vary significantly:

**Range:** 1.85% to 7.0% local tax

**Combined State + Local Rates:**
- **Lowest:** Cameron Parish = 5.0% (no local tax)
- **Highest:** Sterlington (Ouachita Parish) = 12.95%
- **Average Combined:** Typically 9% to 11.45%

**Domicile-Based Rule:**
The buyer's **domicile** (home parish) determines which local taxes apply, not the parish where the vehicle is purchased.

**Parish Tax Variation Examples:**
- **Orleans Parish (New Orleans):** State 5% + Parish ~5% = ~10% total
- **East Baton Rouge Parish:** State 5% + Parish/City ~4-5% = ~9-10% total
- **Jefferson Parish:** State 5% + Parish ~5% = ~10% total
- **Cameron Parish:** State 5% + Parish 0% = 5% total
- **Ouachita Parish (Monroe/Sterlington):** Up to 12.95-13.5% combined

- **January 1, 2025 – December 31, 2029:** 5.0% state rate
- **January 1, 2030 and beyond:** 4.75% state rate (scheduled decrease)

**Impact:**

**New Resident Use Tax Cap (2025):**

**Effective January 1, 2025:**

Prior to 2025, new residents paid the full use tax based on fair market value with credit for taxes paid in reciprocal states, but no cap.

**Antique Vehicle Exemption (2019):**

**Effective July 1, 2019:**
Louisiana exempted antique vehicles (25+ years old, valued over $10,000, non-commercial use) from state and local vehicle sales taxes.

### 6.3 Implementation Recommendations for AutolytiQ Tax Service

**High Confidence (Implement Now):**
1. State tax rate: **5.0%** (+ local)
2. Trade-in credit: **FULL** (subtract from sale price before tax)
3. Manufacturer rebates: **NOT taxable** (subtract before tax)
4. Dealer rebates: **NOT taxable** (subtract before tax)
5. Accessories: **TAXABLE**
6. Negative equity: **NOT taxable**
7. Lease tax method: **Monthly payment** at 1.45% state + local
8. Reciprocity: **Yes** (rate-to-rate credit for reciprocal states)
9. New resident use tax cap: **$90** (if qualified)

**Medium Confidence (Implement with Conservative Approach):**
1. Doc fee: **TAXABLE** (include in taxable base, capped at $425)
2. Service contracts (VSC): **EXEMPT** (but flag for verification)
3. GAP insurance: **EXEMPT** (but flag for verification)

**Low Confidence (Flag for Manual Review):**
1. Cap cost reduction on leases: **Flag for dealer verification**
2. Trade-in credit on leases: **Flag for dealer verification**
3. Backend products on leases: **Flag for dealer verification**

**Rule Logic for Tax Calculation Engine:**

```typescript
// LOUISIANA TAX CALCULATION - RETAIL SALE
function calculateLouisianaSalesTax(params) {
  const STATE_RATE = 0.05; // 5% as of 2025-01-01
  const localRate = getParishRate(params.buyerParish); // Domicile-based

  let taxableAmount = params.vehiclePrice;

  // Subtract trade-in (full credit)
  if (params.tradeInValue > 0) {
    taxableAmount -= params.tradeInValue;
  }

  // Subtract manufacturer rebates
  if (params.manufacturerRebate > 0) {
    taxableAmount -= params.manufacturerRebate;
  }

  // Subtract dealer rebates
  if (params.dealerRebate > 0) {
    taxableAmount -= params.dealerRebate;
  }

  // Add taxable accessories
  if (params.accessories > 0) {
    taxableAmount += params.accessories;
  }

  // Add doc fee (likely taxable, verify)
  if (params.docFee > 0 && params.docFee <= 425) {
    taxableAmount += params.docFee; // FLAG: Verify with LDR
  }

  // Do NOT add negative equity (not taxable)
  // Do NOT add VSC (likely exempt, verify)
  // Do NOT add GAP (likely exempt, verify)

  const stateTax = taxableAmount * STATE_RATE;
  const localTax = taxableAmount * localRate;
  const totalTax = stateTax + localTax;

  return {
    taxableAmount,
    stateTax,
    localTax,
    totalTax,
    combinedRate: STATE_RATE + localRate
  };
}

// LOUISIANA TAX CALCULATION - LEASE
function calculateLouisianaLeaseTax(params) {
  const STATE_LEASE_RATE = 0.0145; // 1.45% (1% + 0.45%)
  const localRate = getParishLeaseRate(params.buyerParish);

  // Tax on monthly payment
  const monthlyTax = params.monthlyPayment * (STATE_LEASE_RATE + localRate);

  // Cap cost reduction (verify if taxed upfront)
  let upfrontTax = 0;
  if (params.capCostReduction > 0) {
    // FLAG: Verify with LDR if this is taxable
    // upfrontTax = params.capCostReduction * (STATE_LEASE_RATE + localRate);
  }

  return {
    monthlyTax,
    upfrontTax, // Likely > 0, but needs verification
    totalFirstPaymentTax: monthlyTax + upfrontTax
  };
}
```
