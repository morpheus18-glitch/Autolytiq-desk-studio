---

## 1. SALES TAX STRUCTURE

### State Rate
- **Base Rate:** 6.25% of sales price
- **No Local Sales Tax:** Motor vehicles are NOT subject to local sales taxes (unlike general retail sales in Texas which can go up to 8.25% combined)
- **No Cap:** There is no maximum dollar cap on motor vehicle sales tax

### Tax Calculation Formula
```
Sales Tax = (Sales Price - Trade-in Allowance) × 0.0625
```

### Tax Base Determination

#### Dealer Sales (New or Used)
- Tax base = Sales price minus trade-in allowance
- No Standard Presumptive Value (SPV) applies to dealer sales
- Tax calculated on actual negotiated price

#### Private Party Sales (Used Vehicles)
Tax is calculated on the **GREATER OF**:
1. Actual sales price (if buyer paid ≥80% of SPV)
2. 80% of Standard Presumptive Value (if buyer paid <80% of SPV)
3. Certified appraisal value (if provided within 30 days)

**Standard Presumptive Value (SPV):**
- Determined by TxDMV based on regional motor vehicle value guides
- Based on average private-party sales prices
- Vehicle condition is irrelevant to SPV
- Calculator available at: www.txdmv.gov/standard-presumptive-calculator

**Certified Appraisal Option (Form 14-128):**
- Available when buyer pays <80% of SPV
- Must be performed by licensed motor vehicle dealer or licensed insurance adjuster
- Must be obtained within 30 days of purchase (60 days for active military)
- Can reduce tax liability if appraised value is lower than 80% of SPV

## 5. TRADE-IN CREDIT POLICIES

### General Rule
Trade-in value is **fully deductible** from the sales price before calculating sales tax.

### Formula
```
Taxable Amount = Sales Price - Trade-in Value
Sales Tax = Taxable Amount × 0.0625
```

### Requirements
- Trade-in must be a **motor vehicle**
- Trade-in must occur as part of the **same transaction**
- Trade-in must be **transferred directly to the seller**
- Allowance is based on vehicle **value**, not equity

### Example Calculation
```
Vehicle purchase price: $42,000
Trade-in value: $15,000
Taxable amount: $27,000
Sales tax: $27,000 × 0.0625 = $1,687.50
```

### Private Party Sales Exception
- **No trade-in credit** for private party sales
- Tax due on full SPV or purchase price (whichever is higher)

---

## 6. LEASE TAXATION RULES

- **When:** At time of vehicle purchase for lease inventory
- **Rate:** 6.25% of lessor's purchase price
- **Lease Payments:** NO sales tax on monthly payments to lessee

### Calculation
```
Lessor's Tax = Lessor's Purchase Price × 0.0625
(Tax paid at initial title/registration by leasing company)
```

### Special Situations

#### New Residents with Leased Vehicles
- $90 new resident tax applies
- Due even if lessor holds title
- Lessee must be named on lease agreement

## 11. CALCULATION FORMULAS FOR AUTO TAX ENGINE

### Standard Dealer Sale with Trade-In
```javascript
// Base calculation
taxableAmount = salesPrice - tradeInValue
salesTax = taxableAmount * 0.0625

// Total fees
totalTax = salesTax
totalRegistration = baseRegistrationFee + localCountyFee + processingFee +
                    insuranceFee + inspectionReplacementFee
totalTitle = titleFee // $28 or $33 based on county

totalDue = totalTax + totalRegistration + totalTitle
```

### Private Party Sale (Used Vehicle)
```javascript
// Determine tax base
spvAmount = getStandardPresumptiveValue(year, make, model, trim)
spv80Percent = spvAmount * 0.80

if (actualSalesPrice >= spv80Percent) {
    taxBase = actualSalesPrice
} else if (certifiedAppraisalProvided && certifiedAppraisalValue < spv80Percent) {
    taxBase = certifiedAppraisalValue
} else {
    taxBase = spv80Percent
}

salesTax = taxBase * 0.0625

// No trade-in credit for private party
totalDue = salesTax + registrationFees + titleFee
```

### Lease Transaction
```javascript
// Tax paid by lessor at initial purchase
lessorTax = lessorPurchasePrice * 0.0625
// Paid at title/registration by leasing company

// Lessee pays NO sales tax on monthly payments
monthlyPaymentTax = 0

// At lease end purchase
if (lesseeExercisesPurchaseOption) {
    salesTax = purchaseOptionPrice * 0.0625
    // No credit for lessor's original tax payment
}
```

### Out-of-State Purchase (Use Tax)
```javascript
// Texas resident bringing vehicle from another state
texasUseTax = purchasePrice * 0.0625
creditFromOtherState = taxPaidToOtherState // max = texasUseTax
netTexasTax = texasUseTax - creditFromOtherState

totalDue = netTexasTax + registrationFees + titleFee
```

### Gift Transaction
```javascript
if (isEligibleFamilyMember(donor, recipient)) {
    giftTax = 10.00 // flat fee
    totalDue = giftTax + registrationFees + titleFee
} else {
    // Treated as sale, SPV applies
    taxBase = max(actualConsideration, spv80Percent)
    salesTax = taxBase * 0.0625
    totalDue = salesTax + registrationFees + titleFee
}
```

### Registration Fee Calculation
```javascript
function calculateRegistrationFee(vehicleType, weight, isElectric, county) {
    let baseFee = 0

    if (vehicleType === 'PASSENGER_CAR' || vehicleType === 'TRUCK') {
        if (isElectric && weight <= 10000) {
            baseFee = 200 // Annual EV fee (or 400 for initial 2-year)
        } else if (weight <= 6000) {
            baseFee = 50.75
        } else if (weight <= 10000) {
            baseFee = 54.00
        } else {
            baseFee = calculateHeavyVehicleFee(weight) // $110-$840
        }
    } else if (vehicleType === 'MOTORCYCLE') {
        baseFee = 30.00
    } else if (vehicleType === 'TRAILER') {
        baseFee = 45.00
    }

    // Add local county fees
    let localFee = getCountyLocalFee(county) // $0-$31.50

    // Add mandatory fees
    let processingFee = 4.75
    let insuranceFee = 1.00
    let inspectionReplacementFee = 7.50 // As of Jan 1, 2025

    return baseFee + localFee + processingFee + insuranceFee + inspectionReplacementFee
