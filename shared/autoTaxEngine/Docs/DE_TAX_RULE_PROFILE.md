## Special Rules & Considerations

### No Sales Tax Environment

- **Not Capped**: No state-imposed cap on this fee
- **Not a Sales Tax**: This is a processing fee, not a tax on the sale

- **Passenger Vehicles**: Typically $40-$115 for standard passenger vehicles
- **Commercial Vehicles**: Higher fees based on gross vehicle weight
- **Annual Requirement**: Fees are paid annually, not one-time
- **Not a Sales Tax**: These are regulatory fees, not sales taxes

### Why Delaware Has No Sales Tax
- **Constitutional Provision**: Delaware's constitution prohibits a general retail sales tax

### Reciprocity

- **Reasoning**: Since DE has no sales tax, there are no reciprocity credits to give or receive
- **Out-of-State Purchases**: DE residents purchasing in other states must pay that state's sales tax

### Tax-Exempt Status
- Since there is no sales tax, tax-exempt status is not applicable to vehicle purchases
- Government and non-profit entities have no additional advantage
