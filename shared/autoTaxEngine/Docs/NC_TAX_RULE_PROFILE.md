## Executive Summary

North Carolina employs a **Highway Use Tax (HUT)** system instead of traditional sales tax for vehicle transactions. The HUT is a **one-time, state-only tax of 3%** applied at the time of vehicle title and registration. Unlike sales tax, HUT has **no local jurisdiction rates** and is administered by the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles (NCDMV) rather than the Department of Revenue.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- Highway Use Tax (HUT) at 3% state-only (no local rates)
- Full trade-in credit (reduces HUT base)
- Manufacturer rebates reduce taxable amount (dealer rebates do not)
- Documentation fees are subject to HUT
- Service contracts and GAP insurance are NOT subject to HUT
- Leases taxed at 3% on monthly payments (same as retail HUT rate)
- Reciprocity credit available but limited to 90-day time window
- Tax paid at title/registration, not at point of sale

---

## 1. HIGHWAY USE TAX (HUT) OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What is HUT?

The **Highway Use Tax** is North Carolina's equivalent to sales tax for motor vehicles. It was enacted to replace the traditional sales and use tax system for vehicles and is codified in **North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 105, Article 5A**.

**Critical Differences from Sales Tax:**
- **Rate:** Fixed at 3% (state-only, no local rates)
- **Collection Point:** Paid at NCDMV when titling/registering vehicle
- **Jurisdiction:** State-only (no county or city add-ons)
- **Purpose:** Revenue supports state highway fund and transportation infrastructure

### 1.2 Tax Rate

**Current Rate:** 3.0% of purchase price (net of trade-in and manufacturer rebates)

**Comparison:**
| Tax Type | Rate | Local Rates? | Collection Point |
|----------|------|--------------|------------------|
| **North Carolina HUT** | 3.0% | No | NCDMV at title/registration |
| **General NC Sales Tax** | 4.75% + local (up to 2.75%) | Yes | Point of sale |
| **NC Sales Tax Total** | 6.75% - 7.5% combined | Yes | Point of sale |

**Important:** Vehicles are NOT subject to North Carolina's general sales tax. HUT is the **exclusive** tax for motor vehicle purchases.

### 1.3 Legal Basis

- **Primary Statute:** NCGS Chapter 105, Article 5A - Highway Use Tax
- **NCGS § 105-187.1:** Definitions
- **NCGS § 105-187.2:** Tax Imposed
- **NCGS § 105-187.3:** Maximum Tax (for certain vehicle classes)
- **NCGS § 105-187.5:** Credit for Tax Paid to Other States
- **NCGS § 105-187.6:** Exemptions

**Administrative Authority:**
- North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles (NCDMV)
- North Carolina Department of Revenue (certain exemptions and credits)

## 2. RETAIL SALES TAX (HUT)

### 2.1 Tax Base Calculation

**HUT Base Formula:**
```
HUT Base = Purchase Price
         - Trade-In Allowance
         - Manufacturer Rebates
         + Taxable Dealer Fees

HUT = HUT Base × 3%
```

### 2.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT**

North Carolina allows **full trade-in credit** against HUT. The trade-in value is deducted from the purchase price before calculating the 3% HUT.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:               -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $20,000
HUT @ 3%:                         $600
```

**Legal Basis:** NCGS § 105-187.2(b) - "The tax is on the total purchase price less any allowance for a vehicle taken in trade."

**No Cap:** There is no maximum trade-in credit amount.

### 2.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** (reduces purchase price)

Manufacturer rebates, incentives, and cash-back offers **reduce the taxable purchase price** before HUT calculation.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Customer Pays:                 $32,000
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $32,000 (after rebate reduction)
HUT @ 3%:                         $960
```

**Legal Basis:** North Carolina interprets manufacturer rebates as purchase price reductions under NCGS § 105-187.2.

### 2.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (does not reduce purchase price)

Dealer rebates, dealer incentives, and dealer cash-back offers are considered post-sale incentives and do **NOT reduce the HUT base**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Dealer Rebate:                 -$2,000 (NOT deducted for HUT)
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $30,000
HUT @ 3%:                         $900

Customer receives $2,000 rebate after tax is paid.
```

### 2.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

Dealer documentation fees, processing fees, and similar dealer charges **ARE subject to HUT**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Doc Fee:                          $595
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $28,595
HUT @ 3%:                       $857.85
```

**No Cap:** North Carolina does not impose a statutory cap on dealer documentation fees. Fees typically range from $400 to $600+.

### 2.6 Title and Registration Fees

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

Government fees for title and registration are **NOT subject to HUT**.

**Current Fees (2025):**
- **Title Fee:** $56.00
- **License Plate Fee:** $36.00 (standard plate)
- **Registration Fee:** Varies by vehicle weight
- **Highway Use Tax:** 3% of purchase price

**Total Due at NCDMV:**
```
Vehicle Price (after trade-in):    $25,000
HUT @ 3%:                             $750
Title Fee:                             $56
Plate Fee:                             $36
Registration Fee:                      $42 (example)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Due:                            $884
```

### 2.7 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

Extended warranties, vehicle service contracts (VSC), and maintenance agreements are **NOT subject to HUT**.

**Legal Basis:** Service contracts are not considered part of the vehicle purchase price under NCGS § 105-187.1 and are exempt from HUT.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Service Contract:              +$2,500 (NOT taxed)
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $30,000 (VSC excluded)
HUT @ 3%:                         $900
VSC Cost:                       $2,500 (no HUT)
Total:                         $33,400
```

### 2.8 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance is **NOT subject to HUT**.

**Legal Basis:** GAP is classified as an insurance product and is not part of the vehicle purchase price for HUT purposes.

### 2.9 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (if included in vehicle sale)

Accessories installed by the dealer and included in the vehicle sale are **subject to HUT**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Accessories (running boards,
  tonneau cover, audio):       +$2,500
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $30,500
HUT @ 3%:                         $915
```

**Timing Matters:** If accessories are sold separately after the vehicle sale, they may be subject to general sales tax instead of HUT. Best practice is to include accessories in the original vehicle sale to apply the lower 3% HUT rate.

### 2.10 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (added to purchase price)

Negative equity from a trade-in (when trade-in payoff exceeds trade-in value) is **added to the HUT base**.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $28,000
Trade-In Value:                $12,000
Trade-In Payoff:              -$15,000
Negative Equity:               -$3,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Vehicle Price:             $16,000 ($28k - $12k trade)
Negative Equity Added:         +$3,000
─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $19,000
HUT @ 3%:                         $570

Amount Financed:               $19,570 ($19,000 + $570 HUT)
```

**Legal Reasoning:** Negative equity increases the amount financed and is considered part of the total consideration paid for the vehicle.

## 3. LEASE TAXATION (HUT ON MONTHLY PAYMENTS)

### 3.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION**

North Carolina applies **3% HUT to each monthly lease payment** (the same rate as retail HUT). This is a **monthly taxation method** with no upfront tax on capitalized cost reduction.

**Key Features:**
- 3% state HUT on each monthly payment
- No local rates (state-only)
- No upfront HUT on down payments or cap cost reduction
- Tax paid monthly as part of lease payment
- Same 3% rate as retail HUT

### 3.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXED**

Capitalized cost reductions (cash down, trade-in equity, rebates) are **NOT subject to HUT** on leases.

**Example:**
```
Gross Capitalized Cost:        $35,000
Cap Cost Reduction:
  Cash Down:                   -$4,000 (NOT taxed)
  Trade-In:                    -$6,000 (NOT taxed)
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $25,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $425
Monthly HUT @ 3%:                $12.75
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $437.75
```

### 3.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT**

Trade-ins reduce the capitalized cost on leases, lowering the monthly payment and thus the monthly HUT.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $40,000
Trade-In Allowance:           -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $30,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $500
Monthly HUT @ 3%:                 $15
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:            $515
```

**Advantage:** Trade-ins on leases receive the same full credit as retail purchases, reducing the cap cost and lowering monthly HUT.

### 3.4 Rebates on Leases

**Policy:** **FOLLOW RETAIL RULE**

Rebates on leases are treated the same as retail:
- **Manufacturer rebates:** Reduce cap cost (not taxed)
- **Dealer rebates:** Do not reduce taxable payments

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $38,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000 (reduces cap cost)
Dealer Rebate:                 -$1,000 (does NOT reduce cap cost)
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $35,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $475
Monthly HUT @ 3%:               $14.25
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $489.25

Customer receives $1,000 dealer rebate separately.
```

### 3.5 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Policy:** Same as retail

| Product | Taxable? | Treatment |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Service Contracts (VSC)** | ❌ No | Not subject to HUT when capitalized into lease |
| **GAP Insurance** | ❌ No | Not subject to HUT when capitalized into lease |
| **Doc Fee** | ✅ Yes | Subject to 3% HUT |

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Service Contract (cap'd):      +$1,800 (NOT taxed)
GAP Insurance (cap'd):           +$695 (NOT taxed)
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $37,495

Monthly Payment (base):           $525
Monthly HUT @ 3%:               $15.75
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $540.75

VSC and GAP are NOT taxed (even when capitalized).
```

### 3.6 Documentation Fee on Leases

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

Doc fees on leases are subject to 3% HUT.

**Example:**
```
Doc Fee:                          $595
HUT @ 3%:                       $17.85
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Doc Fee Cost:             $612.85
```

### 3.7 Negative Equity on Leases

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

Negative equity increases the capitalized cost, which increases monthly payments and thus monthly HUT.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Negative Equity:               +$4,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $39,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $550
Monthly HUT @ 3%:                 $16.50
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:            $566.50
```

## 4. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 4.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** **LIMITED RECIPROCITY** with 90-day time window

North Carolina provides **credit for sales tax or similar tax paid to another state**, but with a **critical 90-day time restriction**.

**Legal Basis:** NCGS § 105-187.5 - Credit for Tax Paid to Another State

### 4.2 How Credits Work

**Scenario 1: Other State Tax ≥ NC HUT (Within 90 Days)**

If sales/use tax paid to another state equals or exceeds NC HUT **AND** was paid within 90 days, **NO additional HUT is due**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in South Carolina 30 days ago:
SC Sales Tax Paid (5%):           $1,500 on $30,000 vehicle
NC HUT Would Be (3%):               $900
Tax Paid Within 90 Days:            YES
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                     $900 (capped at NC HUT)
NC HUT Due:                           $0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Tax < NC HUT (Within 90 Days)**

If tax paid to another state is less than NC HUT **AND** was paid within 90 days, pay the **DIFFERENCE**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana 60 days ago:
MT Sales Tax Paid (0%):               $0
NC HUT Would Be (3%):               $900
Tax Paid Within 90 Days:            YES
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                       $0
NC HUT Due:                         $900
```

### 4.3 Critical 90-Day Time Window

**⚠️ CRITICAL RESTRICTION:**

Tax must have been paid to the other state **within 90 days** of registering in North Carolina to qualify for reciprocity credit.

**Scenario 3: Tax Paid More Than 90 Days Ago**

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Tennessee 100 days ago:
TN Sales Tax Paid (7%):           $2,100 on $30,000 vehicle
NC HUT Would Be (3%):               $900
Tax Paid Within 90 Days:            NO (exceeds 90-day window)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                       $0 (time window expired)
NC HUT Due:                         $900 (FULL NC HUT, no credit)
```

**Legal Basis:** NCGS § 105-187.5 requires the tax to have been "lawfully paid to another state within 90 days."

### 4.4 Documentation Required

To claim reciprocity credit, you must provide:
- Proof of tax paid to other state (receipt, invoice, registration)
- Bill of sale showing vehicle price
- Prior state's title or registration
- Date of tax payment (to verify 90-day window)

### 4.5 Credit Cap

**Rule:** Credit is capped at the NC HUT amount (3% of purchase price).

You receive credit up to NC's tax amount, but you **don't get a refund** if you paid more in another state.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in California 45 days ago:
CA Sales Tax Paid (7.25%):        $2,175 on $30,000 vehicle
NC HUT Would Be (3%):               $900
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                     $900 (capped at NC HUT)
NC HUT Due:                           $0
Excess CA Tax:                    $1,275 (no refund)
```

## 5. UNIQUE NORTH CAROLINA FEATURES

### 5.1 HUT vs. Sales Tax System

**Feature:** North Carolina uses HUT exclusively for vehicles (not sales tax)

**Why Unique:**
- Most states use sales tax for vehicles
- HUT is collected at DMV (not at dealership)
- State-only rate (no local jurisdiction stacking)
- Lower rate than general sales tax (3% vs. 6.75%-7.5%)

**Comparison:**
| Item | Tax Type | Rate | Collection Point |
|------|----------|------|------------------|
| **Motor Vehicles** | HUT | 3.0% | NCDMV |
| **General Retail** | Sales Tax | 4.75% state + up to 2.75% local | Point of sale |
| **Total General** | Combined | 6.75% - 7.5% | Point of sale |

### 5.2 No Local Rates

**Feature:** HUT is state-only (3% flat, no county or city add-ons)

**Why Unique:**
- Most states have local sales tax add-ons (e.g., AZ up to 11.2%, CO up to 15.9%)
- Simplifies calculation (no jurisdiction lookup needed)
- Same rate statewide

**Advantage:** Easy to calculate, no dealer location dependency

### 5.3 Collection at DMV

**Feature:** HUT is paid at NCDMV when titling/registering (not at dealership)

**Process:**
1. Buyer purchases vehicle at dealership
2. Buyer takes bill of sale and paperwork to NCDMV
3. HUT is calculated and paid at NCDMV
4. NCDMV issues title and registration

**Why Different:** Most states collect sales tax at dealership point-of-sale. NC's DMV collection ensures compliance and ties tax payment to registration.

### 5.4 90-Day Reciprocity Time Window

**Feature:** Reciprocity credit only available if tax paid within 90 days

**Why Unique:**
- Most states don't have time restrictions on reciprocity
- Creates urgency for new residents to register vehicles
- Prevents tax avoidance by delaying registration

**Impact:** New NC residents must register vehicles within 90 days to avoid paying full HUT.

### 5.5 Same Rate for Retail and Lease

**Feature:** 3% HUT applies to both retail purchases (one-time) and lease payments (monthly)

**Why Notable:**
- Some states have different rates for sales vs. leases (e.g., AL 2% sales vs. 1.5% lease)
- NC applies the same 3% rate, simplifying calculation

### 5.6 Service Contracts and GAP Not Taxed

**Feature:** VSC and GAP are exempt from HUT (both retail and lease)

**Why Notable:**
- Some states tax these products (e.g., WV taxes VSC and GAP)
- NC exemption is favorable for F&I product sales

**Example:**
```
Private party sale price:      $15,000

─────────────────────────────────────
HUT Base:                      $15,000
HUT @ 3%:                         $450
```

### Example 4: Reciprocity - Out-of-State Purchase (Within 90 Days)

**Scenario:**
- Vehicle purchased in Virginia 45 days ago
- Purchase price: $28,000
- VA sales tax paid (4.15%): $1,162
- Trade-in: None
- NC HUT would be (3%): $840

**Calculation:**
```

─────────────────────────────────────
Tax paid to VA:                $1,162
Tax paid within 90 days:        YES (45 days)
Reciprocity eligible:           YES

STEP 2: Calculate NC HUT Credit
─────────────────────────────────────
NC HUT (3% of $28,000):          $840
VA Tax Paid:                   $1,162
Credit Allowed:                  $840 (capped at NC HUT)
─────────────────────────────────────

STEP 3: Total Due at NC DMV
─────────────────────────────────────
NC HUT:                            $0 (credit applied)
Title Fee:                        $56
Plate Fee:                        $36
Registration:                     $42
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Due:                       $134

Virginia tax savings: $0 (already paid $1,162 in VA)
No additional tax owed to NC.
```

### Example 5: Reciprocity - Expired Time Window

**Scenario:**
- Vehicle purchased in Tennessee 120 days ago
- Purchase price: $30,000
- TN sales tax paid (7%): $2,100
- Trade-in: None
- NC HUT would be (3%): $900

**Calculation:**
```
STEP 1: Verify Reciprocity Eligibility
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax paid to TN:                $2,100
Tax paid within 90 days:        NO (120 days)
Reciprocity eligible:           NO (time window expired)

STEP 2: Calculate NC HUT Due
─────────────────────────────────────
NC HUT (3% of $30,000):          $900
TN Tax Credit:                     $0 (NOT eligible)
─────────────────────────────────────
NC HUT Due:                      $900 (FULL HUT)

STEP 3: Total Due at NC DMV
─────────────────────────────────────
NC HUT:                          $900
Title Fee:                        $56
Plate Fee:                        $36
Registration:                     $42
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Due:                     $1,034

⚠️ Customer must pay full NC HUT ($900) because 90-day
   time window expired, despite having paid $2,100 in TN.

- [ ] Trade-in payoff amount (if negative equity)
- [ ] Manufacturer rebates (amount)
- [ ] Dealer rebates (amount)
- [ ] Documentation fee
- [ ] Accessories included in sale
- [ ] Service contracts (VSC) - NOT taxable
- [ ] GAP insurance - NOT taxable

**For Out-of-State Buyers:**

- [ ] Cap cost reductions (itemized)
- [ ] Trade-in allowance
- [ ] Monthly lease payment
- [ ] Lease term (months)
- [ ] Service contracts (capitalized)
- [ ] GAP insurance (capitalized)

### 9.2 Calculation Logic - RETAIL

```
STEP 1: Calculate HUT Base
  HUT_Base = Sale_Price
           - Trade_In_Value
           - Manufacturer_Rebates
           + Doc_Fee

STEP 2: Calculate HUT
  HUT = HUT_Base × 0.03

STEP 3: Non-Taxable Items
  VSC_Cost = Service_Contract_Amount (NOT taxed)
  GAP_Cost = GAP_Amount (NOT taxed)
  Title_Fee = $56 (NOT taxed)
  Plate_Fee = $36 (NOT taxed)
  Registration = Variable (NOT taxed)

STEP 4: Total Due
  Total = HUT_Base + HUT + VSC_Cost + GAP_Cost + Title_Fee + Plate_Fee + Registration
```

### 9.3 Calculation Logic - LEASE

```
STEP 1: Calculate Monthly HUT
  Monthly_HUT = Monthly_Payment × 0.03

STEP 2: Calculate Doc Fee HUT (Upfront)
  Doc_Fee_HUT = Doc_Fee × 0.03

STEP 3: Non-Taxable Cap Reduction
  Cap_Reduction_Tax = $0
  (Cash down, trade-in, rebates NOT taxed)

STEP 4: Total Monthly Payment
  Total_Monthly = Monthly_Payment + Monthly_HUT

STEP 5: Total Lease HUT
  Total_HUT = Doc_Fee_HUT + (Monthly_HUT × Lease_Term_Months)
```

### 9.4 Validation Rules

**System should validate/flag:**

1. **90-Day Reciprocity Window**
   - If claiming reciprocity credit, verify tax paid within 90 days
   - Flag if date exceeds 90 days: "Reciprocity credit NOT available (90-day window expired)"

2. **VSC or GAP Taxed**
   - Error: "Service contracts and GAP are NOT subject to NC HUT"

3. **Manufacturer Rebate Not Deducted**
   - Warning: "Manufacturer rebates should reduce HUT base"

4. **Trade-In on Private Sale**
   - Error: "Trade-in credit NOT available on private party sales"

5. **Negative Equity Not Added**
   - Warning: "Negative equity should be added to HUT base"

### 9.5 Error Messages

```
ERROR: VSC is taxed
→ "Service contracts are NOT subject to NC Highway Use Tax (HUT).
   Remove HUT from service contract amount."

WARNING: Reciprocity credit claim
→ "Tax paid to [State] was $X on [Date]. This exceeds the 90-day
   window for NC HUT reciprocity. Full NC HUT of $Y is due."

ERROR: Private sale with trade-in credit
→ "Trade-in credit is NOT available on private party sales in NC.
   Full HUT of $X is due on sale price."
