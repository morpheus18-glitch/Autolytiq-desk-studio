## Executive Summary

Tennessee has a **7% state sales tax** (one of the highest state rates in the nation) with additional local taxes ranging from 2.25% to 2.75%, resulting in combined rates of **9.25% to 9.75%**. The state allows **full trade-in credit** for both retail and lease transactions. Tennessee has a unique **single article tax cap** that caps the state portion at $224 for most vehicles, dramatically reducing tax on expensive vehicles. Tennessee is **one of few states that taxes service contracts/VSC** but does NOT tax GAP insurance. Documentation fees are **capped at $495** (statutory limit).

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- Single article tax cap: State tax capped at $224 for vehicles >$1,600 (local taxes NOT capped)
- Service contracts (VSC) are TAXABLE (unusual - most states exempt)
- GAP insurance is NOT taxable (different treatment than VSC)
- Doc fee capped at $495 (TCA § 55-3-122)
- Manufacturer and dealer rebates reduce taxable amount (TCA § 67-6-341 credit)
- Full trade-in credit on both retail and lease (unlike AL which has no lease credit)
- Wheel tax replaces vehicle property tax ($50-$100+ annually by county)
- Monthly lease taxation method
- Among highest combined tax rates in US (9.25%-9.75%)

## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 Tax Rates (Current 2025)

#### State Rate
- **State Sales Tax:** 7.0% (TCA § 67-6-501 et seq.)
- **Subject to Single Article Tax Cap:** YES (TCA § 67-6-331)
  - Vehicles ≤ $1,600: State tax capped at $112 ($1,600 × 7%)
  - Vehicles > $1,600: State tax capped at $224 ($3,200 × 7%)

#### Local Rates
**Structure:** State + County + City
- **Local Tax Range:** 2.25% to 2.75%
- **Local Taxes:** NOT subject to single article tax cap (apply to full price)

**Combined Rates by Major Jurisdiction:**
| Location | State | Local | Total | Cap Impact |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| Memphis (Shelby County) | 7.0% | 2.75% | 9.75% | State capped at $224 |
| Nashville (Davidson County) | 7.0% | 2.25% | 9.25% | State capped at $224 |
| Knoxville (Knox County) | 7.0% | 2.25% | 9.25% | State capped at $224 |
| Chattanooga (Hamilton County) | 7.0% | 2.25% | 9.25% | State capped at $224 |

**Note:** Tennessee's combined rates (9.25%-9.75%) are among the highest in the nation. However, the single article tax cap dramatically reduces effective tax on expensive vehicles.

#### Single Article Tax Cap Impact

**Effective Tax Rates (Nashville 9.25% combined):**
| Vehicle Price | State Tax | Local Tax | Total Tax | Effective Rate |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| $15,000 | $224 (cap) | $337.50 | $561.50 | 3.74% |
| $30,000 | $224 (cap) | $675.00 | $899.00 | 3.00% |
| $50,000 | $224 (cap) | $1,125.00 | $1,349.00 | 2.70% |
| $100,000 | $224 (cap) | $2,250.00 | $2,474.00 | 2.47% |

The cap creates a **regressive tax structure** where expensive vehicles pay a much lower effective tax rate than moderate-priced vehicles.

**Tax Savings Example ($50,000 vehicle in Nashville):**
```
Without Cap: $50,000 × 9.25% = $4,625.00
With Cap:    $224 (state) + $1,125 (local) = $1,349.00
Savings:     $3,276.00 (71% reduction)
```

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL** - Trade-in credit applies to BOTH state and local taxes

#### How It Works
1. Trade-in value is deducted from vehicle purchase price
2. Sales tax calculated on **net amount** (purchase price minus trade-in)
3. Credit applies to **both state and local** portions (unlike Alabama)

**Official Guidance (TN DOR County Clerk Manual):**
- "Before any credit may be allowed for trade-ins, the item traded must be of a like kind and character of that purchased, and indicated as 'trade-in' by model and serial number on an invoice given to the customer."
- "The statute nor the rule requires that proof be given that tax was paid previously, whether in Tennessee or in another state, on the traded-in item in order to receive any trade-in credit."

**Example Calculation (Nashville 9.25%):**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:               -$10,000
Net Taxable Amount:            $20,000

State Tax:  MIN($20,000 × 7%, $224) = $224 (capped)
Local Tax:  $20,000 × 2.25% = $450
Total Tax:  $674

Without Trade-In:
State Tax:  $224 (capped)
Local Tax:  $675
Total Tax:  $899
Savings:    $225 (from local portion)
```

**Key Difference from Alabama:**
- **Tennessee:** Trade-in credit applies to BOTH state and local taxes
- **Alabama:** Trade-in credit applies ONLY to state tax (local taxes ignore trade-in)

**Source:** TN DOR County Clerk Sales and Use Tax Manual for Automobiles & Boats (August 2021)

### 1.3 Manufacturer & Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NON-TAXABLE** - Both reduce taxable amount

#### Manufacturer Rebates (Customer Cash)
- Manufacturer rebates (customer cash, loyalty bonuses, conquest rebates, EV credits) reduce the selling price
- Tax is calculated on net price AFTER rebate
- Rebate DOES reduce tax base

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $25,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$2,000
Selling Price:                 $23,000

Tax Base:                      $23,000 (rebate reduces base)
State Tax:  MIN($23,000 × 7%, $224) = $224 (capped)
Local Tax:  $23,000 × 2.25% = $517.50
Total Tax:  $741.50
```

#### Dealer Incentive Payments (TCA § 67-6-341)

Tennessee has a **special provision** for "motor vehicle manufacturer's incentive payments" that requires dealers to reduce the sales price.

**Statutory Text (TCA § 67-6-341):**
> "A credit is granted for the amount of sales tax due on motor vehicle manufacturer's incentive payments included in the sales price, such that sales tax is owed on the sales price of the motor vehicle less any otherwise taxable motor vehicle manufacturer's incentive payment associated with the sale."

**Requirements for Credit:**
- Program sponsored by motor vehicle manufacturer
- Amount received by retailer based on unit price of vehicles sold at retail
- Requires retailer to reduce sales price to purchaser
- Does NOT use manufacturer's coupon or redemption certificate
- **Only applies to retail sales** (not sales to leasing companies for resale)

**Source:** TCA § 67-6-341; TN DOR Automotive Dealership Manual (December 2023)

### 1.4 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee)

**Policy:** TAXABLE, **Capped at $495** (statutory limit)

#### Statutory Cap
**TCA § 55-3-122:**
> "The maximum amount that may be charged by any dealer for preparing the documentation required for the sale of a motor vehicle shall not exceed four hundred ninety-five dollars ($495)."

- **Cap Amount:** $495
- **Effective Date:** July 1, 2019 (increased from prior cap)
- **Legal Authority:** TN DOR Important Notice #19-14

#### Taxability
Doc fee is **included in the taxable base** and subject to:
- 7% state sales tax (subject to single article cap)
- Full local tax rate (NOT capped)

**Example:**
```
Doc Fee:                       $495
Combined Rate:                 9.25%

State Tax on Doc Fee:          Contributes to capped $224
Local Tax on Doc Fee:          $495 × 2.25% = $11.14
```

The doc fee is added to the vehicle price to determine total taxable base, then the single article cap applies to the total state tax calculation.

### 1.5 Service Contracts and GAP Insurance

#### Service Contracts (VSC) - **TAXABLE** (Unusual)

**Tennessee is one of FEW states that taxes warranty/service contracts.**

**Statutory Basis (TCA § 67-6-208):**
> "The retail sale of, use of, or subscription to a warranty or service contract covering the repair or maintenance of tangible personal property shall be subject to the tax levied by this chapter."

**Tax Treatment:**
- Total sales price subject to 7% state rate plus local tax rate
- Taxed at time of sale of the contract
- Subsequent repairs performed under warranty are NOT subject to tax
- Extended warranty/service contracts are taxed separately when sold with motor vehicles

**Example:**
```
VSC Price:                     $2,500
Combined Rate:                 9.25%
Tax on VSC:                    $2,500 × 9.25% = $231.25
```

**Source:** TCA § 67-6-208; TN DOR Sales and Use Tax Guide

#### GAP Insurance - **NOT TAXABLE**

**GAP insurance is NOT subject to sales tax in Tennessee.**

- Treated as insurance product, exempt from sales tax
- Different treatment than VSC (which is taxable)
- Consistent with most states' treatment of insurance products

**Key Insight:** Tennessee's treatment creates a unique situation where VSC is taxable but GAP is not, despite both being vehicle protection products. This differs from most states which exempt both.

### 1.6 Other Fees and Products

**Title Fee:**
- NOT taxable (government fee paid to County Clerk)
- Must be separately stated on invoice

**Registration Fees:**
- NOT taxable (government fees)

**Wheel Tax:**
- NOT taxable (annual county registration tax)
- Varies by county: $50-$100+ depending on jurisdiction
- Replaces vehicle property tax in Tennessee
- Paid annually at registration renewal

**Accessories:**
- TAXABLE when dealer-installed as part of vehicle sale
- Subject to full combined rate (state + local)
- Included in single article tax cap calculation

**Negative Equity:**
- TAXABLE when rolled into financed amount
- Increases total taxable base for both state and local tax

**Example with Negative Equity:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $25,000
Trade-In Value:                $12,000
Trade-In Payoff:               $15,000
Negative Equity:               $3,000

Taxable Base:                  $25,000 - $12,000 + $3,000 = $16,000

State Tax:  MIN($16,000 × 7%, $224) = $224 (capped)
Local Tax:  $16,000 × 2.25% = $360
Total Tax:  $584
```

### 1.7 Complete Retail Tax Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Nashville dealer (9.25% combined), $45,000 vehicle

```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $45,000
Accessories:                   $2,500
Doc Fee (capped):              $495
Trade-In Value:               -$15,000
Manufacturer Rebate:          -$3,000
Negative Equity:               $0
VSC (taxed separately):        $2,000
GAP (not taxed):               $800

TAXABLE BASE:
$45,000 + $2,500 + $495 - $15,000 - $3,000 = $29,995

STATE TAX:
MIN($29,995 × 7%, $224) = MIN($2,099.65, $224) = $224 (capped)

LOCAL TAX:
$29,995 × 2.25% = $674.89

VEHICLE TAX SUBTOTAL: $224 + $674.89 = $898.89

VSC TAX (taxed separately):
$2,000 × 9.25% = $185.00

TOTAL TAX DUE: $898.89 + $185.00 = $1,083.89

Without Cap (for comparison):
$29,995 × 9.25% = $2,774.54 + $185.00 = $2,959.54
Tax Savings from Cap: $1,875.65
```

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY** - Sales tax charged on each monthly lease payment

**Official Guidance (TN DOR County Clerk Manual):**
> "Sales tax applies to a lease of tangible personal property on the billing basis of the lease payments, either on the lump sum due at the time of the lease execution or on a monthly/periodical basis."

Tennessee taxes leases on a **monthly basis** under TCA § 67-6-331.

### 2.2 Single Article Tax Cap on Leases

**CRITICAL:** The single article tax cap applies to **EACH MONTHLY PAYMENT**

- If monthly payment ≤ $1,600: State portion capped at $112
- If monthly payment > $1,600: State portion capped at $224
- Local tax is NOT capped

**In Practice:**
Most lease payments are under $1,600/month, so the payment is typically well below the cap threshold. The cap would only apply to very expensive vehicle leases with high monthly payments.

**Example - Typical Lease (Nashville 9.25%):**
```
Monthly Payment:               $450
Term:                          36 months

State Tax:  MIN($450 × 7%, $112) = $31.50 (well under cap)
Local Tax:  $450 × 2.25% = $10.13
Total Monthly Tax:             $41.63

Total Tax Over Term:           $41.63 × 36 = $1,498.68
```

**Example - Luxury Lease (Memphis 9.75%):**
```
Monthly Payment:               $1,800 (exceeds $1,600)
Term:                          36 months

State Tax:  MIN($1,800 × 7%, $224) = MIN($126, $224) = $126 (under cap)
Local Tax:  $1,800 × 2.75% = $49.50
Total Monthly Tax:             $175.50

Total Tax Over Term:           $175.50 × 36 = $6,318
```

The cap **rarely applies** to lease payments because:
- $1,600/month payment requires ~$65,000+ cap cost (depending on term/residual)
- Even at $1,600/month, state tax ($112) is under the $112 cap
- Would need payment significantly > $1,600 to hit $224 cap (very rare)

### 2.3 Cap Cost Reductions

**Cap cost reductions are NOT taxed upfront.**

Cap cost reductions (cash down, trade-ins, rebates) reduce the capitalized cost and lower the monthly payment. They are not themselves taxed upfront.

By reducing the monthly payment, cap cost reductions **indirectly reduce the monthly tax** paid over the lease term.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $40,000
Cap Cost Reductions:
  - Cash down:                 $5,000
  - Trade-in equity:           $3,000
  - Manufacturer rebate:       $2,500
  - Total:                     $10,500

Adjusted Cap Cost:             $29,500

Without Reductions:
  Monthly Payment: $550 → Tax: $50.88/month (9.25%)

With Reductions:
  Monthly Payment: $400 → Tax: $37.00/month (9.25%)

Monthly Tax Savings:           $13.88
Total Savings (36 months):     $499.68
```

### 2.4 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **FULL** - Trade-ins on leases receive full credit

Trade-in value reduces the gross cap cost, lowering the adjusted cap cost and thus the monthly payment. By reducing the monthly payment, the trade-in **indirectly reduces the monthly tax**.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Trade-In Value:               -$10,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $25,000

Without Trade-In:
  Monthly Payment: $480 → Tax: $44.40/month (9.25%)

With Trade-In:
  Monthly Payment: $350 → Tax: $32.38/month (9.25%)

Monthly Tax Savings:           $12.03
Total Savings (36 months):     $433.08
```

**Key Difference from Alabama:**
- **Tennessee:** FULL trade-in credit on leases
- **Alabama:** NO trade-in credit on leases (trade-in equity is taxed as cap cost reduction)

### 2.5 Rebate Treatment on Leases

**Policy:** **FOLLOW_RETAIL_RULE**

Manufacturer rebates applied as cap cost reduction reduce the adjusted cap cost, lower the monthly payment, and thus reduce monthly tax.

**NOTE:** TCA § 67-6-341 explicitly states the dealer incentive payment credit "only applies to sales at retail, so incentive payments received by the dealer for sales to a leasing company for resale do not qualify for the credit."

**This means:**
- **Direct consumer leases:** Rebates reduce cap cost (lower payment, lower tax)
- **Dealer sales to leasing company:** Incentive payment credit does NOT apply

### 2.6 Negative Equity on Leases

**Negative equity is TAXABLE on leases.**

Negative equity rolled into a lease increases the gross cap cost, which increases the monthly payment and thus increases the monthly tax paid.

**Example:**
```
Base Cap Cost:                 $30,000
Trade-In Value:                $12,000
Trade-In Payoff:               $15,000
Negative Equity:               $3,000

Adjusted Cap Cost:             $33,000

Without Negative Equity:
  Monthly Payment: $400 → Tax: $37.00/month (9.25%)

With Negative Equity:
  Monthly Payment: $440 → Tax: $40.70/month (9.25%)

Additional Monthly Tax:        $3.70
Total Additional Tax (36 mo):  $133.20
```

### 2.7 Doc Fee on Leases

**Doc fees on leases are TAXABLE.**

- Subject to same $495 statutory cap (TCA § 55-3-122)
- Typically paid upfront (at lease signing) and taxed at that time
- Can be capitalized into lease (increases cap cost, thus monthly payment and tax)

**Example - Upfront Payment:**
```
Doc Fee:                       $495
Combined Rate:                 9.25%
Tax on Doc Fee:                $495 × 9.25% = $45.79 (paid at signing)
```

**Example - Capitalized:**
```
Doc Fee:                       $495 (added to cap cost)
Increases monthly payment:     ~$14/month (36-month lease)
Increases monthly tax:         ~$1.30/month
Total tax on doc fee:          ~$46.80 over term
```

### 2.8 Service Contracts and GAP on Leases

**Service Contracts (VSC):**
- **TAXABLE** when capitalized into lease (same as retail)
- Increases cap cost and thus monthly payment
- Monthly tax applies to portion of payment attributable to VSC

**GAP Insurance:**
- **NOT taxable** (insurance product, same as retail)

Tennessee maintains **consistent treatment** between retail and lease for VSC and GAP.

### 2.9 Complete Lease Tax Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Nashville (9.25%), 36-month lease

```
Gross Cap Cost:                $40,000
Cap Cost Reductions:
  - Cash down:                 $5,000
  - Trade-in equity:           $4,000
  - Manufacturer rebate:       $2,000
  - Total:                     $11,000

Adjusted Cap Cost:             $29,000
Residual Value:                $20,000 (50%)
Money Factor:                  0.00125 (3% APR)

Base Monthly Payment:          $400 (depreciation + finance charge)

MONTHLY TAX:
State Tax:  MIN($400 × 7%, $112) = $28.00 (under cap)
Local Tax:  $400 × 2.25% = $9.00
Total Monthly Tax:             $37.00

TOTAL MONTHLY PAYMENT:         $400 + $37 = $437

UPFRONT COSTS (At Signing):
Doc Fee:                       $495
Tax on Doc Fee:                $495 × 9.25% = $45.79
First Month Payment:           $437
Title Fee (not taxed):         $75
Wheel Tax (not taxed):         $75
Total Due at Signing:          $1,127.79

TOTAL TAX OVER LEASE TERM:
Monthly Tax:                   $37.00 × 36 = $1,332
Doc Fee Tax (upfront):         $45.79
Total Lease Tax:               $1,377.79
```

**If VSC Added ($2,000 capitalized):**
```
VSC added to cap cost:         $2,000
New Adjusted Cap Cost:         $31,000
New Monthly Payment:           $455
New Monthly Tax:               $42.09

Additional Monthly Tax:        $5.09
Additional Total Tax (36 mo):  $183.24
```

## 3. RECIPROCITY (OUT-OF-STATE PURCHASES)

### 3.1 Reciprocity Policy

**Policy:** **CREDIT_UP_TO_STATE_RATE** - Credit for taxes paid elsewhere, capped at TN rate

When a vehicle is purchased out-of-state and brought to Tennessee for registration, the buyer must pay Tennessee use tax. However, any sales tax paid to the other state is **credited** against the Tennessee use tax due.

### 3.2 How Reciprocity Works

#### Scenario 1: Other State Tax ≥ Tennessee Tax
If sales/use tax paid to another state equals or exceeds Tennessee's tax (including the single article cap), **NO additional Tennessee use tax is due**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Illinois: $50,000
Illinois tax paid (7.25%):     $3,625

Tennessee tax would be (Nashville 9.25%):
  State:                       $224 (capped)
  Local:                       $1,125
  Total:                       $1,349

Credit allowed:                $1,349 (full TN amount)
Additional TN tax due:         $0
```

#### Scenario 2: Other State Tax < Tennessee Tax
If tax paid to another state is less than Tennessee's tax, pay the **DIFFERENCE**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana:  $50,000
Montana tax paid (0%):         $0

Tennessee tax due (Nashville): $1,349
Credit allowed:                $0
Additional TN tax due:         $1,349
```

#### Scenario 3: Other State Tax Between Zero and TN Tax
**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Kentucky: $30,000
Kentucky tax paid (6%):        $1,800

Tennessee tax would be (Nashville 9.25%):
  State:                       $224 (capped)
  Local:                       $675
  Total:                       $899

Credit allowed:                $899 (capped at TN amount, even though KY paid more)
Additional TN tax due:         $0
```

### 3.3 Single Article Cap Advantage

**IMPORTANT:** The single article tax cap **significantly benefits** out-of-state purchases.

For expensive vehicles, Tennessee's capped tax is often much lower than what was paid in other states, resulting in **$0 additional tax** when registering in TN.

**Example (Expensive Vehicle):**
```
$100,000 vehicle bought in California
California tax paid (7.5%):    $7,500

Tennessee tax would be (Nashville):
  State:                       $224 (capped)
  Local:                       $2,250
  Total:                       $2,474

Credit:                        $2,474 (capped at TN amount)
Additional TN tax:             $0

Total tax paid:                $7,500 to CA, $0 to TN
Effective tax rate:            7.5% (much higher than TN's 2.47%)
```

### 3.4 Documentation Required

To receive reciprocity credit, provide:
- Proof of sales tax paid to other state (receipt, title, registration)
- Invoice or bill of sale showing vehicle price
- Evidence that tax was legally imposed (not voluntary payment)

### 3.5 Reciprocity on Leases

Reciprocity applies to **BOTH retail purchases and leases**.

For leased vehicles registered in Tennessee after being leased elsewhere, the same credit principles apply to the monthly tax calculation.

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**For DSL Implementation:**

1. **Single Article Tax Cap:**
   - Must calculate state tax separately from local tax
   - Apply cap to state portion only: `MIN(taxableBase × 7%, capAmount)`
   - Cap amount: $112 if base ≤ $1,600, else $224
   - Local tax NOT capped: `taxableBase × localRate`

2. **VSC Taxability:**
   - Flag `taxOnServiceContracts: true`
   - VSC taxed separately from vehicle (not included in single article cap)
   - Full combined rate applies to VSC

3. **Lease Taxation:**
   - Monthly method: tax each payment
   - Single article cap applies to EACH payment
   - Most payments under cap threshold ($1,600)

4. **Reciprocity:**
   - Credit capped at Tennessee's amount (including single article cap)
   - For expensive vehicles, TN tax often lower than other states
   - Results in $0 additional tax in many cases

5. **Doc Fee:**
   - Statutory cap: $495
   - Validation required: reject doc fees > $495
