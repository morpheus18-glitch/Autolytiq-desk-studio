**Formula:**
```
Illinois Use Tax Due = (IL Tax Rate - Other State Tax Rate) × Purchase Price
```

**Example:**

- Difference owed to Illinois: 2.025% + any applicable local taxes

- Due within 30 days of purchase/acquisition

**Tax Structure - TWO TIER SYSTEM:**

**Tier 1: Purchase Price UNDER $15,000**

- Trade-in NOT deductible
- Reference: Form RUT-5 (Private Party Vehicle Use Tax Chart)

- Ages gradually decrease
- 2014 or older model year: ~$100

- Trade-in NOT deductible

**Example Price-Based Tiers (≥$15,000):**

---

## 5. TRADE-IN CREDIT POLICIES

### Dealer Sales - FULL TRADE-IN CREDIT

**Current Law (Effective January 1, 2022):**
- **FULL trade-in credit** with NO CAP
- Trade-in value fully deducted from purchase price before calculating sales tax
- Public Act 102-0353 removed previous $10,000 cap

**Formula:**
```
Taxable Amount = Purchase Price - Trade-in Value
Sales Tax = Taxable Amount × (State Rate + Local Rates)
```

**Example:**
```
Vehicle price: $35,000
Trade-in value: $10,000
Taxable amount: $25,000
Tax at 10%: $2,500 (savings of $1,000 vs. no trade-in credit)
```

**Historical Context:**
- Pre-2020: No tax on trade-in value
- 2020-2021: Tax applied to trade-in value above $10,000
- January 1, 2022 - Present: Full credit restored

### Private Party Sales - NO TRADE-IN CREDIT

**Private Party Rule:**
- Trade-in deduction is **NOT ALLOWED** on private party vehicle use tax
- Tax calculated based on vehicle age (under $15,000) or price tier (≥$15,000)
- Trade-in has no effect on tax calculation

---

## 6. LEASE TAXATION RULES

### Current System (2024-2025)

**Vehicle Lease Taxation:**
- Lessors owe use tax at point of purchase
- Lessees are exempt from retailers' occupation or use tax
- Sales tax paid on MONTHLY LEASE PAYMENTS, not full vehicle value
- Tax rate: Same as purchase (6.25% state + applicable local taxes)

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Tax = Monthly Payment × (State Rate + Local Rates)
```

### CHICAGO RESIDENTS SPECIAL - CRITICAL

**Additional 8% PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASE USE TAX:**
- Applies to Chicago residents only
- ON TOP OF the standard sales tax rate on lease payments
- **Total tax for Chicago residents: 9.5% sales tax + 8% use tax = 17.5% effective**
- Only applies to Chicago RESIDENTS (based on residency, not dealer location)
- Codified in Chicago Municipal Code Chapter 3-32

**Rate Breakdown:**

**Chicago Retail (Purchase):**
- 10.25% total (6.25% state + 1.25% city + 1.75% Cook + 1% RTA)

**Chicago Lease (Monthly Payment):**
- 9.5% sales tax component
- + 8% Chicago use tax
- = **17.5% total effective rate**

**Suburban Cook County (Lease):**
- 8.25% sales tax (6.25% state + 1.75% county + 0.25% varies)
- NO additional use tax on leases
- No 8% Chicago surcharge

**Rest of State (Lease):**
- Standard monthly lease taxation
- No additional lease-specific taxes
- Varies by local rates (6.25% to ~8.75%)

### 2015 Law Change Impact

**Important Note:** Starting January 1, 2015, Illinois ELIMINATED the trade-in tax credit benefit on leases.

**Before 2015:** Tax was on full cap cost → trade-in reduced taxable base
**After 2015:** Tax is on monthly payment → trade-in has no tax benefit

Trade-ins still have value (reduce monthly payment), but provide no direct sales tax savings on leases.
