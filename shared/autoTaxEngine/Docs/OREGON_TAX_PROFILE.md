## 8. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 8.1 No Sales Tax Structure

**Key Differentiator:**
- Oregon is one of only five U.S. states without general sales tax
- Creates price advantage for vehicle purchases (especially high-dollar vehicles)
- Attracts buyers from neighboring states (Washington, California)

**Trade-off:**
- Higher registration fees (especially for EVs and high-MPG vehicles)
- Alternative revenue sources: fuel taxes, registration fees, vehicle-specific taxes

### 8.2 MPG-Based Fee Structure

**Philosophy:**
- Higher fees for fuel-efficient vehicles
- Compensates for lower fuel tax revenue
- Progressive adjustment: 0-19 MPG < 20-39 MPG < 40+ MPG < Electric

**2025 Adjustments:**
- Significant increases for high-efficiency vehicles
- 40+ MPG and EV fees increasing by $144 (two-year registration)
- Lower-MPG vehicles increasing by $84

### 8.3 OReGO Road Usage Charge Program

**Alternative to Weight-Mile Tax:**
- First-in-nation voluntary RUC program
- Charges by distance traveled instead of fuel consumed
- $0.02 per mile rate

**Advantages for EV/High-MPG Owners:**
- Can reduce registration costs significantly
- EV registration drops from $460 to $86 (two-year)
- Benefit for low-mileage drivers

**Enrollment:**
- Voluntary (for now)
- Requires mileage reporting device or smartphone app
- Privacy protections for location data

**Future Direction:**
- Oregon exploring expansion of RUC to replace fuel taxes
- Addresses long-term decline in fuel tax revenue

**Source:** Oregon DOT OReGO Program (oregon.gov/odot/programs/pages/orego.aspx)

### 8.4 Vehicle Privilege/Use Tax Revenue Allocation

**VPT Revenue Allocation:**
- Zero-Emission Incentive Fund
- Connect Oregon Fund (multimodal transportation projects)

**VUT Revenue Allocation:**
- State Highway Fund (road maintenance and construction)

**Purpose:**
- Dedicated funding streams for transportation infrastructure
- Supports transition to zero-emission vehicles

**Source:** ORS 320.435

## 10. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TAX-SVC

### 10.1 Data Requirements

**Required Inputs:**
- `vehicle.price` (retail sales price)
- `vehicle.msrp` (for lease calculations)
- `vehicle.mpg_combined` (determines title/registration fees)
- `vehicle.gvwr` (determines taxability: must be ≤ 26,000 lbs)
- `vehicle.odometer` (determines taxability: must be ≤ 7,500 miles for VPT/VUT)
- `vehicle.fuel_type` (gas/diesel/hybrid/electric/other)
- `vehicle.is_new` (boolean)
- `customer.state` (buyer residence)
- `customer.county` (for county registration fees)
- `dealer.state` (dealer location)
- `purchase_type` ("retail" | "lease")
- `out_of_state_tax_paid` (optional, for VUT credit calculation)
- `use_integrator` (boolean, affects doc fee cap)
- `effective_date` (for applying Dec 31, 2025 fee increases)

### 10.2 Business Logic

**VPT Calculation (Oregon Dealer to Any Buyer):**
```rust
if dealer.state == "OR"
   && vehicle.odometer <= 7500
   && vehicle.gvwr <= 26000
   && !vehicle.previously_registered_in_OR
{
    vpt = vehicle.price * 0.005;
    // Dealer may collect from buyer, but tax is dealer's liability
}
```

**VUT Calculation (Out-of-State Dealer to Oregon Buyer):**
```rust
if customer.state == "OR"
   && dealer.state != "OR"
   && vehicle.odometer <= 7500
   && vehicle.gvwr <= 26000
   && !vehicle.previously_registered_in_OR
{
    vut_base = vehicle.price * 0.005;
    vut_credit = min(out_of_state_tax_paid, vut_base);
    vut_owed = vut_base - vut_credit;
}
```

**Title Fee Lookup:**
```rust
fn get_title_fee(fuel_type: FuelType, mpg: Option<i32>, effective_date: Date) -> Decimal {
    let is_new_rate = effective_date >= Date::from_ymd(2025, 12, 31);

    match fuel_type {
        FuelType::Electric => if is_new_rate { 331.00 } else { 192.00 },
        _ => {
            let mpg = mpg.unwrap_or(0);
            if is_new_rate {
                if mpg >= 40 { 255.00 }
                else if mpg >= 20 { 245.00 }
                else { 240.00 }

                if mpg >= 40 { 116.00 }
                else if mpg >= 20 { 106.00 }
                else { 101.00 }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Registration Fee Lookup:**
```rust
fn get_registration_fee(fuel_type: FuelType, mpg: Option<i32>, effective_date: Date) -> Decimal {
    let is_new_rate = effective_date >= Date::from_ymd(2025, 12, 31);

    match fuel_type {
        FuelType::Electric => if is_new_rate { 460.00 } else { 316.00 },
        _ => {
            let mpg = mpg.unwrap_or(0);
            if is_new_rate {
                if mpg >= 40 { 300.00 }
                else if mpg >= 20 { 220.00 }
                else { 210.00 }
            } else {
                if mpg >= 40 { 156.00 }
                else if mpg >= 20 { 136.00 }
                else { 126.00 }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**County Fee Lookup:**
```rust
fn get_county_fee(county: &str) -> Decimal {
    match county {
        "Multnomah" => 112.00,
        "Washington" | "Clackamas" => 60.00,
        _ => 0.00
    }
}
```

**Doc Fee Cap:**
```rust
fn get_doc_fee_cap(use_integrator: bool) -> Decimal {
    if use_integrator { 250.00 } else { 200.00 }
}
```

### 10.4 Edge Cases and Validation

**Heavy Vehicles (GVWR > 26,000 lbs):**
- NOT subject to VPT or VUT
- Different title/registration fee schedule
- Should return error or different calculation path

**High-Mileage Vehicles (> 7,500 miles):**
- NOT subject to VPT or VUT
- Still need title/registration fees
- Validate odometer reading

**Previously Registered in Oregon:**
- NOT subject to VPT or VUT (already paid)
- Title transfer fee may differ
- Check vehicle history

**Out-of-State Tax Credit:**
- Cannot exceed Oregon VUT base amount
- Requires documentation (should prompt user to retain receipts)
- If credit >= VUT, then VUT = $0

**Non-Resident Purchases:**
- Exempt from VPT
- May need temporary permit fees
- Different documentation requirements

**Lease Calculations:**
- VUT typically lessor's responsibility (if applicable)
- Lessee pays title/registration fees
- No sales tax on monthly payments
- Monthly payment not taxed (unlike most states)

### 10.5 Caching Strategy

**Static Data (Cache indefinitely, clear on deployment):**
- MPG tier thresholds
- County names and fees
- Doc fee caps
- Plate fees

**Date-Dependent Data (Cache until Dec 31, 2025, then invalidate):**
- Title fees
- Registration fees
- Use effective_date in cache key

**Dynamic Data (No caching):**
- VPT/VUT calculations (depends on vehicle price)
- Out-of-state tax credits (depends on customer-provided data)

### 10.6 Testing Scenarios

1. **New gas vehicle, Oregon dealer, Oregon buyer, before Dec 31, 2025**
2. **New gas vehicle, Oregon dealer, Oregon buyer, on/after Dec 31, 2025**
3. **Used EV, out-of-state dealer, Oregon buyer, with sales tax credit**
4. **New hybrid lease, Oregon dealer, Multnomah County resident**
5. **Heavy commercial vehicle (GVWR > 26,000 lbs) - should not apply VPT/VUT**
6. **High-mileage used vehicle (> 7,500 miles) - should not apply VPT/VUT**
7. **Non-resident buyer from Oregon dealer - VPT exemption**
8. **Previously registered Oregon vehicle - no VPT/VUT**
