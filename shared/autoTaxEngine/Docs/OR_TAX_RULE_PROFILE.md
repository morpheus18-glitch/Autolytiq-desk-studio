## Executive Summary

Oregon is one of **five U.S. states with NO general sales tax** (along with Alaska, Delaware, Montana, and New Hampshire). This fundamentally distinguishes Oregon from most other states. However, Oregon imposes specific vehicle-related taxes:

- **Vehicle Privilege Tax (VPT):** 0.5% on retail sales by Oregon dealers
- **Vehicle Use Tax (VUT):** 0.5% on out-of-state purchases by Oregon residents

- NO sales tax on vehicle purchases or leases
- NO tax on accessories, service contracts, GAP, or any backend products
- Trade-in credit mechanism does NOT apply (no sales tax to reduce)
- Rebates are NOT subject to taxation (no sales tax exists)
- Minimal 0.5% VPT/VUT only applies to qualifying vehicles
- Full reciprocity credit often results in $0 Oregon VUT for out-of-state purchases
- Title and registration fees are the primary costs (not taxes)
- Major fee increases effective December 31, 2025 (HB 3991)

**Fee Highlights (Effective Dec 31, 2025):**
- Title fees: $240-$331 (varies by MPG/electric)
- Registration fees: $210-$460 for two years (varies by MPG/electric)
- Doc fee cap: $200-$250 (depending on integrator use)

## 1. NO SALES TAX FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 General Sales Tax

**OREGON HAS NO GENERAL SALES TAX**

Oregon is one of five U.S. states without a general sales tax. This means:
- **0% tax on vehicle purchases**
- **0% tax on lease payments**
- **0% tax on accessories**
- **0% tax on service contracts, GAP, or any backend products**
- **0% tax on documentation fees**

**Source:** Oregon Constitution; Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 320

---

### 1.2 What This Means for Vehicle Transactions

**For Buyers:**
- No sales tax calculation needed
- Price negotiation focuses on vehicle cost, not tax optimization
- Trade-ins reduce cash due but don't affect taxes (since there are none)
- Rebates reduce price but aren't "taxable" or "non-taxable" (concept doesn't apply)
- Backend products (VSC, GAP) have no tax implications

**For Dealers:**
- No sales tax collection responsibility (except VPT on qualifying vehicles)
- No monthly sales tax returns for sales transactions
- Documentation fee is simply part of the cash price (not subject to taxation)

**For Lessors:**
- No tax on monthly lease payments
- No upfront taxation of capitalized cost
- May owe Vehicle Use Tax if acquiring vehicles from out-of-state

**Comparison to Sales Tax States:**
```
Example: $30,000 Vehicle Purchase

Sales Tax State (9% rate):
  Vehicle Price:               $30,000
  Sales Tax:                   $2,700
  Total Cost:                  $32,700

Oregon:
  Vehicle Price:               $30,000
  Sales Tax:                   $0
  VPT (0.5%):                  $150 (dealer may collect)
  Total Cost:                  $30,150

Savings:                       $2,550
```

## 2. VEHICLE PRIVILEGE TAX (VPT)

### 2.1 Overview

**Vehicle Privilege Tax (VPT):** A 0.5% tax on retail sales by Oregon dealers

The VPT is Oregon's minimal vehicle tax, significantly lower than traditional sales taxes in other states.

**Rate:** 0.5% (one-half of one percent)

**Source:** Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 320.405

---

### 2.2 When VPT Applies

**Qualifying Vehicles:**
VPT applies to vehicles that meet ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Sold at retail by an Oregon dealer**
2. **Sale date: January 1, 2018 or later**
3. **Odometer reading: 7,500 miles or less** (if equipped with odometer)
4. **GVWR ≤ 26,000 lbs** (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating)
5. **Never previously registered or titled in Oregon**

**What Qualifies:**
- New vehicles from Oregon dealers
- "Nearly new" vehicles (≤7,500 miles) from Oregon dealers
- Light-duty vehicles and trucks (under 26,000 lbs GVWR)

**What Does NOT Qualify (Exempt from VPT):**
- Used vehicles with more than 7,500 miles
- Vehicles previously registered in Oregon
- Heavy commercial vehicles (GVWR > 26,000 lbs)
- Private party sales (dealer not involved)
- Vehicles purchased before January 1, 2018
- Motorcycles, ATVs, boats, RVs (different rules may apply)

**Example:**
```
Scenario 1: NEW vehicle from Oregon dealer
  Vehicle Price:               $35,000
  Odometer:                    12 miles
  VPT (0.5%):                  $175
  VPT Applies:                 YES

Scenario 2: USED vehicle from Oregon dealer
  Vehicle Price:               $25,000
  Odometer:                    15,000 miles
  VPT (0.5%):                  N/A
  VPT Applies:                 NO (exceeds 7,500 miles)

Scenario 3: HEAVY truck from Oregon dealer
  Vehicle Price:               $60,000
  Odometer:                    50 miles
  GVWR:                        28,000 lbs
  VPT (0.5%):                  N/A
  VPT Applies:                 NO (exceeds 26,000 lbs GVWR)
```

### 2.3 Who Pays VPT?

**Primary Taxpayer:** Vehicle dealer (not the buyer)

The dealer is legally responsible for the VPT and must file quarterly returns with the Oregon Department of Revenue.

**Common Practice:** Dealers typically collect the VPT amount from the buyer as part of the transaction, but this is NOT a legal requirement. The buyer has no direct tax liability for VPT.

**Example Transaction:**
```
Buyer's Perspective:
  Vehicle Price:               $30,000
  Doc Fee:                     $250
  VPT (collected by dealer):   $150
  Title Fee:                   $240
  Registration Fee:            $210
  ───────────────────────────
  Total Cash Due:              $30,850

Dealer's Perspective:
  Vehicle Price (received):    $30,000
  Doc Fee (received):          $250
  VPT (collected):             $150
  VPT (owed to state):         $150
  Net Revenue:                 $30,250
```

**Filing Requirement:**
- Dealers file quarterly VPT returns
- Due: Last day of month following each quarter
- Filed through Oregon Revenue Online

## 3. VEHICLE USE TAX (VUT)

### 3.1 Overview

**Vehicle Use Tax (VUT):** A 0.5% tax on out-of-state purchases by Oregon residents

The VUT ensures Oregon residents pay a minimal tax when purchasing vehicles from out-of-state dealers, similar to use tax concepts in other states.

**Rate:** 0.5% (one-half of one percent)

**Source:** Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 320.410

---

### 3.2 When VUT Applies

**Who Owes VUT:**
- Oregon residents who purchase a qualifying vehicle from an out-of-state dealer
- Oregon residents who purchase from private sellers in other states
- Anyone registering a qualifying vehicle in Oregon that was purchased outside Oregon

**Qualifying Vehicles:**
Same criteria as VPT:
1. **Odometer reading: 7,500 miles or less** (if equipped with odometer)
2. **GVWR ≤ 26,000 lbs**
3. **Never previously registered in Oregon**

**What Does NOT Trigger VUT:**
- Used vehicles with more than 7,500 miles
- Vehicles previously registered in Oregon
- Heavy commercial vehicles (GVWR > 26,000 lbs)
- Vehicles for which the purchaser paid sales/use/privilege/excise tax to another jurisdiction (credit may reduce VUT to $0)

**Example:**
```
Oregon Resident Buys in California:
  Vehicle Price:               $30,000
  California Sales Tax (paid): $2,625 (8.75%)
  Oregon VUT Base:             $150 (0.5%)
  Credit for CA Tax:           $150 (full VUT amount)
  Oregon VUT Due:              $0

Oregon Resident Buys in Montana (no sales tax):
  Vehicle Price:               $30,000
  Montana Sales Tax (paid):    $0 (MT has no sales tax)
  Oregon VUT Base:             $150 (0.5%)
  Credit:                      $0 (no tax paid)
  Oregon VUT Due:              $150
```

**Source:** ORS 320.410; ORS 320.420

### 3.3 Payment and Collection

**Taxpayer:** The purchaser (Oregon resident buying out-of-state)

**Due Date:** Within 30 days of purchase

**How to Pay:**
- Oregon DMV collects VUT at time of title/registration
- Purchaser must report the purchase and pay VUT when registering vehicle in Oregon

**Credit for Out-of-State Tax:**
Oregon provides a **dollar-for-dollar credit** for ANY sales, use, privilege, or excise tax paid to ANY other jurisdiction (state, county, city, or country).

**Credit Mechanics:**
```
VUT Calculation:
  Step 1: Calculate Oregon VUT base (0.5% of retail price)
  Step 2: Determine amount of tax paid to other jurisdiction
  Step 3: Apply credit (dollar-for-dollar, up to VUT base amount)
  Step 4: If credit ≥ VUT base, Oregon VUT = $0

Example 1 (High-Tax State):
  Vehicle Price:               $40,000
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $200
  California Tax Paid (8.75%): $3,500
  Credit Applied:              $200 (limited to VUT base)
  Oregon VUT Due:              $0

Example 2 (No-Sales-Tax State):
  Vehicle Price:               $40,000
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $200
  Montana Tax Paid:            $0 (no sales tax)
  Credit Applied:              $0
  Oregon VUT Due:              $200
```

## 4. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 4.1 Full Reciprocity Credit

**Policy:** Oregon provides **FULL DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR CREDIT** for any tax paid elsewhere

Oregon's reciprocity policy is one of the most generous in the nation. Unlike many states that only offer reciprocity to specific states or cap credits, Oregon provides a credit for ANY tax paid to ANY jurisdiction.

**Credit Characteristics:**
- **Basis:** Dollar-for-dollar (not rate-to-rate)
- **Scope:** ANY sales, use, privilege, or excise tax paid to ANY jurisdiction
- **Cap:** Credit cannot exceed Oregon VUT owed (0.5% of price)
- **Proof Required:** YES - purchaser must provide receipts/documentation

**What Qualifies for Credit:**
- State sales tax
- County sales tax
- City/municipal sales tax
- Use tax
- Privilege tax (like Oregon's own VPT)
- Excise tax on vehicles
- Foreign country vehicle taxes

**Practical Effect:**
Since most states have sales tax rates significantly higher than Oregon's 0.5% VUT, Oregon residents who purchase vehicles in most other states and pay that state's sales tax will owe **$0 Oregon VUT** after applying the credit.

**Example Scenarios:**
```
Scenario 1: Oregon resident buys in Washington
  Vehicle Price:               $35,000
  WA Sales Tax (6.5% min):     $2,275
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $175
  Credit Applied:              $175
  Oregon VUT Due:              $0

Scenario 2: Oregon resident buys in Texas
  Vehicle Price:               $35,000
  TX Sales Tax (6.25%):        $2,187.50
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $175
  Credit Applied:              $175
  Oregon VUT Due:              $0

Scenario 3: Oregon resident buys in Alaska
  Vehicle Price:               $35,000
  AK Sales Tax:                $0 (AK has no state sales tax)
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $175
  Credit Applied:              $0
  Oregon VUT Due:              $175
```

**States Without Sales Tax (Full Oregon VUT Applies):**
- Alaska (AK) - No state sales tax
- Delaware (DE) - No sales tax
- Montana (MT) - No sales tax
- New Hampshire (NH) - No sales tax
- Oregon (OR) - No sales tax (VPT applies instead)

### 4.2 Non-Resident Purchases in Oregon

**Policy:** Non-residents are **EXEMPT** from Vehicle Privilege Tax

When a non-resident purchases a vehicle from an Oregon dealer, they do NOT owe Oregon VPT.

**Requirements:**
- Purchaser must provide proof of out-of-state residence
- Vehicle must be primarily used and stored outside Oregon
- Vehicle will be registered in another state

**Benefit:**
Non-residents can purchase vehicles in Oregon without paying Oregon VPT (0.5%) or any sales tax, making Oregon an attractive state for vehicle purchases.

**Example:**
```
California resident buys in Oregon:
  Vehicle Price:               $30,000
  Oregon VPT:                  $0 (non-resident exempt)
  Oregon Sales Tax:            $0 (Oregon has no sales tax)
  Total Oregon Tax:            $0

  (Buyer will owe California use tax when registering in CA)
```

**Important Note:**
The non-resident will typically owe use tax in their home state when registering the vehicle. However, the immediate savings at purchase can be significant.

## 5. FEES (NOT TAXES)

### 5.1 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee)

**Nature:** Service fee charged by dealer (NOT a tax)

Oregon has NO sales tax, so the doc fee is simply part of the transaction cost and is NOT subject to any taxation.

**Cap Amount:**

**WITH INTEGRATOR: $250 maximum**
**WITHOUT INTEGRATOR: $200 maximum**

**What is an "Integrator"?**
An integrator is a third-party service that submits DMV documents electronically on behalf of the dealer. Dealers using this service may charge up to $250; those not using it may charge up to $200.

**Legal Basis:** Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 822.043

**What Doc Fees Cover:**
- Document preparation
- DMV submission services
- Credit investigation
- Compliance activities
- Administrative costs

**Negotiability:**
Doc fees in Oregon are negotiable between dealer and purchaser. The caps represent maximum amounts, not mandated fees.

**Example:**
```
Doc Fee (with integrator):     $250 (maximum)
Tax on Doc Fee:                $0 (no sales tax in Oregon)
Total Doc Fee Cost:            $250
```

## 6. LEASE TAXATION

### 6.1 No Tax on Lease Payments

**OREGON DOES NOT TAX LEASE PAYMENTS**

Since Oregon has no sales tax, there is no tax on:
- Monthly lease payments
- Upfront lease fees
- Capitalized cost reductions
- Lease acquisition fees
- Any other lease-related charges

**What Lessees Pay:**
- Monthly lease payment (no tax)
- Title fee (standard state fee)
- Registration fee (standard state fee)
- Any applicable county fees
- Documentation fee (if charged by dealer/lessor)

**Example Lease:**
```
Monthly Lease Payment:         $400
Oregon Lease Tax:              $0 (no sales tax)
Title Fee:                     $240 (standard)
Registration Fee (2-year):     $220 (standard)
Total First Payment:           $860 (payment + title + half registration)

Subsequent Monthly Payments:   $400 (no tax)
```

**Comparison to Sales Tax State:**
```
Same Lease Terms:
  Base Monthly Payment:        $400

Sales Tax State (9% rate):
  Monthly Tax:                 $36
  Total Monthly Payment:       $436

Oregon:
  Monthly Tax:                 $0
  Total Monthly Payment:       $400

Monthly Savings:               $36
Annual Savings:                $432
36-Month Savings:              $1,296
```

### 6.2 Lessor's Vehicle Use Tax Responsibility

**When Lessor Owes VUT:**
If a lessor (leasing company) purchases a qualifying vehicle from an out-of-state dealer to add to their Oregon lease fleet, the lessor may owe Oregon Vehicle Use Tax (0.5%).

**Typical Practice:**
- Lessor pays VUT on vehicle acquisition (if applicable)
- VUT cost is built into the lease structure (depreciation, money factor)
- VUT is NOT separately charged to lessee on monthly payments

**Example:**
```
Lessor purchases vehicle from out-of-state manufacturer:
  Vehicle Acquisition Cost:    $35,000
  Oregon VUT (0.5%):           $175
  VUT paid by:                 Lessor
  VUT charged to lessee:       Not separately (built into lease structure)
```

## 7. SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND EXEMPTIONS

### 7.1 OReGO - Oregon Road Usage Charge Program

**Program Overview:**
Oregon operates the nation's first Road Usage Charge (RUC) program, called **OReGO**.

**Purpose:**
Provides an alternative funding mechanism for electric vehicle owners who don't pay gas taxes.

**Eligibility:**
- Electric vehicles
- High-efficiency vehicles (40+ MPG)
- Voluntary enrollment

**How It Works:**
- Participants pay $0.02 per mile driven (road usage charge)
- In exchange, registration fees are significantly reduced
- Participants receive a refund for any gas taxes paid at the pump

**Financial Benefit (Electric Vehicles):**
```
Standard Registration (2-year, after Dec 31, 2025):
  Without OReGO:               $460

With OReGO:
  Reduced Registration:        $86
  RUC (example 10,000 mi/yr):  $200/year × 2 = $400
  Total (2-year):              $486

Benefit for Low-Mileage Drivers:
  If driving < 9,350 miles/year, OReGO is cheaper than standard registration
```

**Example Low-Mileage Driver:**
```
Annual Mileage:                6,000 miles
RUC Cost per Year:             $120 (6,000 × $0.02)
Registration (annual portion): $43 ($86/2)
Total Annual Cost:             $163

Standard Registration:         $230/year ($460/2)
Savings with OReGO:            $67/year
```

## 8. UNIQUE OREGON FEATURES

### 8.1 No Sales Tax State

**Fundamental Difference:**
Oregon's lack of a general sales tax fundamentally changes the vehicle purchase and lease experience compared to 45 other states.

**Consumer Benefits:**
- Simplified transactions (no tax calculation)
- Lower total vehicle cost
- No complexity around taxability of accessories, backend products, etc.
- Trade-ins simply reduce cash due (no tax optimization needed)
- Rebates simply reduce price (no taxability analysis)

**System Implementation Impact:**
- Tax calculation logic is minimal (only 0.5% VPT/VUT for qualifying vehicles)
- No need for complex taxability rules for VSC, GAP, accessories, etc.
- No monthly payment tax calculations for leases
- No cap cost reduction taxation
- No upfront lease taxation

---

### 8.2 Minimal 0.5% VPT/VUT

**Significantly Lower Than National Average:**
While most states have sales tax rates of 6% to 10%, Oregon's vehicle taxes are only 0.5%.

**Impact Example:**
```
$40,000 Vehicle Purchase:

Oregon:
  VPT (0.5%):                  $200
  Other Fees:                  ~$450
  Total Tax/Fees:              ~$650

Typical Sales Tax State (8%):
  Sales Tax (8%):              $3,200
  Other Fees:                  ~$300
  Total Tax/Fees:              ~$3,500

Oregon Savings:                $2,850 (82% lower)
```

---

### 8.3 Full Reciprocity Credit

**Most Generous Reciprocity in the Nation:**
Oregon's dollar-for-dollar credit for ANY tax paid to ANY jurisdiction is more generous than most states.

**Comparison:**
- **Many States:** Only offer reciprocity to specific states
- **Some States:** Cap credits at their state's rate
- **Oregon:** Full dollar-for-dollar credit for any tax, to any jurisdiction, worldwide

**Practical Effect:**
Oregon residents buying vehicles out-of-state almost never owe Oregon VUT, since other states' taxes typically exceed Oregon's 0.5% VUT.

### 8.4 Significant Fee Increases (HB 3991)

**Major Fee Increases Effective December 31, 2025:**
Oregon House Bill 3991 (2025 Session) significantly increases title and registration fees.

**Title Fee Increases:**
- +$139 for most vehicles (72%-138% increase)

**Registration Fee Increases:**
- +$84 for conventional vehicles (67% increase)
- +$144 for high-MPG and electric vehicles (46%-92% increase)

**Impact:**
While Oregon avoids sales tax, the fee increases mean the upfront cost of titling and registering a vehicle in Oregon has increased substantially.

**Example (Electric Vehicle, after Dec 31, 2025):**
```
Title Fee:                     $331
Registration (2-year):         $460
Total:                         $791

Previous (before Dec 31):      $508
Increase:                      +$283 (56% increase)
```

**Source:** House Bill 3991 (2025 Session)

### 8.5 MPG-Based Fee Structure

**Fee Differentiation by Fuel Efficiency:**
Oregon uses fuel efficiency (MPG) to determine title and registration fees, with higher fees for more efficient vehicles.

**Rationale:**
Higher-efficiency vehicles consume less fuel, generating less gas tax revenue. Higher fees compensate for this lost revenue.

**Fee Tiers (Post-Dec 31, 2025):**
```
Passenger Vehicles (Registration, 2-year):
  0-19 MPG:                    $210
  20-39 MPG:                   $220 (+$10)
  40+ MPG:                     $300 (+$80 over 20-39 MPG)
  Electric:                    $460 (+$160 over 40+ MPG)
```

**Impact:**
Electric vehicle owners pay significantly higher fees than conventional vehicle owners.

**Alternative:** OReGO program allows EV owners to reduce registration to $86 by paying $0.02/mile instead.

## 11. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TAX CALCULATION SYSTEM

### 11.1 Required Data Points

**Vehicle Transaction Data:**
- Vehicle sale price (gross amount)
- Odometer reading (to determine VPT/VUT applicability)
- GVWR (to determine VPT/VUT applicability)
- Vehicle type (passenger, truck, electric, etc.)
- MPG rating (for fee calculation)
- New vs. used status

**Transaction Type:**
- Purchase vs. Lease
- In-state (Oregon dealer) vs. out-of-state purchase
- Buyer residency (Oregon resident vs. non-resident)

**For Out-of-State Purchases:**
- State/country where vehicle was purchased
- Tax paid to other jurisdiction (amount and documentation)

**Fee Calculation:**
- Title fee tier (based on MPG/electric status)
- Registration fee tier (based on MPG/electric status)
- County of residence (for county fees)
- Doc fee amount (capped at $200-$250)

---

### 11.2 Calculation Logic

#### VPT CALCULATION (Oregon Dealer Sale):

```
STEP 1: Determine if VPT Applies
  Check ALL criteria:
    - Sold by Oregon dealer? (YES required)
    - Sale date ≥ Jan 1, 2018? (YES required)
    - Odometer ≤ 7,500 miles? (YES required)
    - GVWR ≤ 26,000 lbs? (YES required)
    - Never registered in Oregon? (YES required)

STEP 2: Calculate VPT (if applicable)
  VPT = Sale_Price × 0.005 (0.5%)

STEP 3: VPT is Dealer's Responsibility
  Dealer may collect VPT from buyer (common practice)
  Buyer's invoice may show VPT as separate line item

Example:
  Vehicle Price:               $32,000
  Odometer:                    18 miles
  GVWR:                        6,200 lbs
  Oregon Dealer:               YES

  VPT Applies:                 YES
  VPT Amount (0.5%):           $160
```

#### VUT CALCULATION (Out-of-State Purchase):

```
STEP 1: Determine if VUT Applies
  Check ALL criteria:
    - Oregon resident? (YES required)
    - Purchased out-of-state? (YES required)
    - Odometer ≤ 7,500 miles? (YES required)
    - GVWR ≤ 26,000 lbs? (YES required)
    - Never registered in Oregon? (YES required)

STEP 2: Calculate VUT Base
  VUT_Base = Purchase_Price × 0.005 (0.5%)

STEP 3: Apply Credit for Out-of-State Tax
  Credit = MIN(Tax_Paid_Elsewhere, VUT_Base)
  VUT_Due = VUT_Base - Credit

STEP 4: If Credit ≥ VUT_Base, then VUT_Due = $0

Example 1 (California Purchase):
  Vehicle Price:               $35,000
  CA Sales Tax Paid (8.75%):   $3,062.50
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $175
  Credit Applied:              $175 (limited to VUT base)
  Oregon VUT Due:              $0

Example 2 (Montana Purchase):
  Vehicle Price:               $35,000
  MT Sales Tax Paid:           $0 (no sales tax)
  Oregon VUT Base (0.5%):      $175
  Credit Applied:              $0
  Oregon VUT Due:              $175
```

#### FEE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Determine Applicable Date
  Is transaction date before or after Dec 31, 2025?

STEP 2: Determine Vehicle Classification
  - Passenger vehicle (check MPG tier)
  - Electric vehicle
  - Motorcycle/Moped
  - Light trailer
  - Heavy vehicle (GVWR > 26,000)

STEP 3: Look Up Title Fee
  Use appropriate fee schedule based on date and classification

STEP 4: Look Up Registration Fee (Two-Year)
  Use appropriate fee schedule based on date and classification

STEP 5: Check County Fees
  If vehicle will be registered in Multnomah, Washington, or Clackamas County:
    Add applicable county fee

STEP 6: Add Other Fees
  Doc Fee (if applicable): $200-$250 max
  Plate Fee: $26 (two plates) or $13 (one plate)
  VIN Inspection: $9 (if out-of-state title)

Example (Electric Vehicle, Multnomah County, After Dec 31, 2025):
  Title Fee:                   $331
  Registration (2-year):       $460
  County Fee (2-year):         $112
  Plate Fee:                   $26
  VIN Inspection:              $9
  Doc Fee:                     $250
  ──────────────────────────
  Total Fees:                  $1,188

  VPT (if applicable):         $175 (0.5% of $35,000 vehicle)
  ──────────────────────────
  Total Due:                   $1,363
```
