## Special Rules & Considerations

### No Sales Tax Whatsoever

### Reciprocity

- **Revenue Sources**: State relies on other revenue sources (property tax, business taxes, fees)
- **Constitutional**: No constitutional prohibition, but strong political opposition to sales tax
- **Competitive Advantage**: Border advantage for retail sales vs. neighboring states

### Tax-Exempt Status

- Government and non-profit entities have no sales tax advantage
