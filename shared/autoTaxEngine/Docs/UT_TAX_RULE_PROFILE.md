---

## Tax Rates

### Motor Vehicle Sales Tax
- **State Rate:** 6.85% (uniform statewide)
- **Local Rates:** NONE
- **Combined Rate:** 6.85% (everywhere)

### General Sales Tax (for comparison)
- **State Rate:** 4.85%
- **Local Rates:** Up to 4.2%
- **Combined Range:** 6.1% to 9.05%

### Simplicity Advantage
Utah's uniform motor vehicle rate eliminates:
- Rate lookup complexity
- Jurisdiction determination
- Dealer location considerations
- City/county boundary issues

---

## Trade-In Policy

### Type: FULL (100% Credit)

**Requirements:**
- **Vehicle-to-Vehicle ONLY:** Credit applies only when trading vehicle for vehicle
- **Same Transaction:** Trade and purchase must occur simultaneously
- **Documented Together:** Must be on same sales agreement
- **Other Trades:** Non-vehicle trades are subject to tax

**Official Guidance (UT Tax Commission Publication 5):**
> "Trades are only allowed for a vehicle-to-vehicle trade and must take place at the same time and must be documented in the same transaction. All other trades are valued and are subject to tax."

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:     $30,000
Doc Fee:              $305
Trade-In Value:   -$10,000
─────────────────────────
Taxable Base:      $20,305
Tax @ 6.85%:       $1,391
```

---

## Rebate Treatment

### Manufacturer Rebates: NON-TAXABLE (Favorable to Buyer)

**Official Guidance (UT Tax Commission Publication 5):**
> "Amounts of manufacturer's rebates, whether paid to the purchaser or retained by the dealer as a down payment, are excluded from the taxable base."

**Key Points:**
- Rebate **REDUCES** the purchase price for tax purposes
- Tax calculated on price **AFTER** rebate
- Applies whether rebate goes to customer OR dealer retains it
- Both scenarios: rebate reduces taxable amount

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:          $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:   -$5,000
─────────────────────────────
Selling Price:         $30,000
Doc Fee:                  $305
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:          $30,305
Tax @ 6.85%:           $2,076
```

**Contrast with Other States:**
- **Alabama, Colorado:** Manufacturer rebates ARE taxable (no reduction)
- **Utah:** Manufacturer rebates reduce tax base (favorable to buyer)

### Dealer Rebates: NON-TAXABLE

If dealer reduces actual selling price, tax is on reduced price.

---

## Documentation Fee

### Taxability: TAXABLE

**Average Fee:** $305
**Statutory Cap:** NONE (no legal limit)
**Range:** $200 to $500+

**Consumer Protection:**
- Each customer must pay **same fee amount** at dealership
- Dealers must display signage stating fees are **NOT state-mandated**
- Must be listed **separately** on purchase agreement

**Example:**
```
Vehicle:      $28,000
Doc Fee:         $305
Trade-In:     -$8,000
─────────────────────
Taxable:      $20,305
Tax @ 6.85%:  $1,391
```

---

## Backend Product Taxability

### Service Contracts (VSC): **TAXABLE** ⚠️ UNIQUE FEATURE

**Utah Tax Commission Ruling 97-004:**
> "If a customer purchases an extended warranty contract, the charge for the warranty contract is taxable at the time of sale."

**Rationale:**
> "Sales of warranty agreements and service plans are taxable, and the tax must be collected at the time of sale of the agreement, as the service agreement is considered advance payment for future taxable repairs."

**Key Points:**
- Tax collected when contract is sold
- Considered advance payment for future repairs
- **Contrasts with most states** where VSC is NOT taxable

**Example:**
```
Vehicle:      $30,000
VSC:           $2,500 ← TAXABLE
Doc Fee:         $305
Trade-In:    -$10,000
─────────────────────
Taxable:      $22,805
Tax @ 6.85%:  $1,562
```

### GAP Insurance: NOT TAXABLE

**Utah Tax Commission Ruling 95-025:**
> "Charges for Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) coverage plans that protect the purchaser in the event of certain property losses are not taxable."

**Example:**
```
Vehicle:      $30,000
Doc Fee:         $305
Trade-In:    -$10,000
─────────────────────
Taxable:      $20,305
Tax @ 6.85%:  $1,391
GAP (not taxed): $895 ← Added after tax
─────────────────────
Total:        $22,591
```

### Summary Table

| Product                | Taxable? | Notes                           |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| Accessories            | ✅ Yes   | Taxed at 6.85%                  |
| Doc Fee                | ✅ Yes   | No cap (avg $305)               |
| Service Contracts (VSC)| ✅ Yes   | **UNIQUE to Utah**              |
| GAP Insurance          | ❌ No    | Insurance product               |
| Negative Equity        | ❌ No    | Not part of taxable base        |
| Title Fee              | ❌ No    | Government fee                  |
| Registration Fee       | ❌ No    | Government fee                  |

## Lease Taxation

### Method: HYBRID (Upfront + Monthly)

**Official Guidance (UT Tax Commission):**
> "Sales tax in Utah is calculated on both your down payment and your monthly lease payments. This means you only pay taxes for as long as you lease the vehicle rather than paying a lump sum of sales tax."

### Rate
- **6.85%** uniform statewide (same as retail)

### What is Taxed

**Upfront (at signing):**
- Down payment / capitalized cost reduction
- First monthly payment (if paid upfront)
- Doc fees, acquisition fees
- Cash down payments
- Rebates applied as cap reduction

**Monthly:**
- Each lease payment amount
- Finance charges included in payment

**NOT Taxed:**
- Payoffs of prior obligations
- License/registration/titling fees
- Refundable security deposits

### Trade-In on Leases: ALLOWED ✅

**Official Guidance (UT Tax Commission Publication 5):**
> "The trade-in credit for an owned vehicle is allowed against the typical lease situation if the trade equity reduces the periodic lease payments to the lessor."

**How It Works:**
- Trade-in equity reduces adjusted cap cost
- Lower cap cost = lower monthly payment
- Tax calculated on **LOWER** monthly payment
- Trade equity effectively reduces tax burden

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:       $40,000
Trade-In Value:        -$8,000
───────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:     $32,000

Without trade: Payment = $550/month → Tax = $37.68/month
With trade:    Payment = $450/month → Tax = $30.83/month
                                      Monthly savings: $6.85
```

**Contrast:** Alabama taxes trade-in equity as cap reduction; Utah allows credit.

### Calculation Example

**36-Month Lease:**
```
Down Payment:      $3,000
Doc Fee:             $395
First Payment:       $450
─────────────────────────
Total Upfront:     $3,845

Upfront Tax:  $3,845 × 6.85% = $263.38 (due at signing)

Monthly Payment: $450 × 36 months
Monthly Tax:     $450 × 6.85% = $30.83/month

Total Tax: $263.38 + ($30.83 × 36) = $1,373.26
```

### Backend Products on Leases

| Product                | Taxable? | Notes                           |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| Service Contracts (VSC)| ✅ Yes   | Same as retail                  |
| GAP Insurance          | ❌ No    | Same as retail                  |
| Doc Fee                | ✅ Yes   | Taxed upfront                   |
| Acquisition Fee        | ✅ Yes   | Taxed at 6.85%                  |
| Title Fee              | ❌ No    | Government fee                  |

## Reciprocity

### Policy: CREDIT (Capped at UT Tax)

**Official Guidance (UT Tax Commission):**
> "A Utah resident who purchases a vehicle outside of Utah may take a sales and use tax credit for tax paid to the other state on the purchase."

> "Utah will allow credit for tax properly due and paid first to a state other than Utah. You can take a credit for the sales or use tax paid to another state. The credit cannot be more than the Utah use tax owed."

### How It Works

**Formula:**
```
UT Tax Owed = (UT Rate 6.85% × Purchase Price) - Other State Tax Paid
Credit is capped at Utah tax amount
```

### Examples

**Example 1: Other State Higher Rate**
```
Vehicle Price:     $30,000
Nevada Tax Paid:    $2,475 (8.25%)
UT Tax Would Be:    $2,055 (6.85%)
Credit Allowed:     $2,055 (limited to UT tax)
Pay to UT:             $0
```

**Example 2: Other State Lower Rate**
```
Vehicle Price:     $30,000
Wyoming Tax Paid:   $1,200 (4%)
UT Tax Would Be:    $2,055 (6.85%)
Credit Allowed:     $1,200
Pay to UT:            $855
```

**Example 3: No Tax State**
```
Vehicle Price:     $30,000
Montana Tax Paid:       $0 (no sales tax)
UT Tax Would Be:    $2,055 (6.85%)
Credit Allowed:         $0
Pay to UT:          $2,055 (full UT tax)
```

### Requirements

**Residency:**
> "A resident is someone who has established domicile in Utah for a total period of six months or more during any calendar year."

**Documentation:**
- Bill of sale showing purchase price
- Receipt showing taxes paid to other state
- Proof tax was "properly due" to other state

### Special Agreements

**Idaho & Wyoming Registration Reciprocity:**
- Allows commuters to use vehicles registered in home state
- **SEPARATE** from sales tax credit
- Does NOT waive sales or use taxes

---

## Tax Calculation Formulas

### Retail Purchase
```
Taxable Base = (Vehicle Price + Accessories + Doc Fee + VSC)
               - Trade-In Value
               - Manufacturer Rebate

Sales Tax = Taxable Base × 6.85%

(GAP NOT included in taxable base)
(Title and registration fees NOT included)
```

### Lease
```
Upfront Tax = (Down Payment + Doc Fee + Taxable Cap Reductions) × 6.85%
Monthly Tax = Monthly Payment × 6.85%
Total Tax = Upfront Tax + (Monthly Tax × Number of Payments)

(Trade-in equity reduces payment, not taxed directly)
(Manufacturer rebates reduce base, not taxed)
```

---

## Compliance Notes

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Trade-Ins:** Vehicle-to-vehicle only, same transaction, documented together
2. **Doc Fees:** Same amount for all customers, disclose not state-mandated

2. ❌ Not taxing service contracts (VSC is taxable in Utah)
3. ❌ Taxing manufacturer rebates (rebates reduce base)
4. ❌ Taxing GAP insurance (GAP is exempt)
5. ❌ Allowing trade credit for non-vehicle trades
6. ❌ Not collecting tax on doc fees
