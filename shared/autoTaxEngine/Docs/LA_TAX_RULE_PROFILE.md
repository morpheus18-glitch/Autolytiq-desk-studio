## Executive Summary

Louisiana employs a **domicile-based sales tax system** with one of the highest combined tax rates in the nation. The state rate is **5.0%** (effective January 1, 2025) with **local parish and municipal taxes ranging from 0% to 7%**, creating combined rates from **5.0% to 13.5%**. Louisiana provides **full trade-in credit** and treats **both manufacturer and dealer rebates as non-taxable** (reducing the purchase price). Leases are taxed on **monthly payments** at a reduced rate of **1.45% state** plus local taxes.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- Domicile-based taxation: Tax rate based on buyer's home parish, NOT dealer location
- Full trade-in credit (100% deduction, applies to both state and local taxes)
- Both manufacturer and dealer rebates reduce taxable price (non-taxable)
- Different rates for purchases vs leases (5% vs 1.45% state)
- Lease tax dedicated to Transportation Trust Fund
- Service contracts and GAP likely exempt (regulated as insurance, verify)
- Doc fee cap: $425 maximum
- New resident use tax cap: $90 (if qualified, effective January 1, 2025)
- Combined tax rates ranging from 5.0% to 13.5%

## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 Tax Rates (Current 2025)

#### State Rate
- **Current State Rate:** 5.0% (effective January 1, 2025)
- **Previous State Rate:** 4.45% (through December 31, 2024)
- **Future State Rate:** 4.75% (effective January 1, 2030)

**State Rate Timeline:**
```
Through Dec 31, 2024:       4.45%
Jan 1, 2025 - Dec 31, 2029: 5.0%
Jan 1, 2030 onwards:        4.75% (scheduled decrease)
```

#### Local Rates
**Structure:** State + Parish + Municipal

**Parish Tax Rates:** Range from 0% to 7.0%
**Municipal Tax Rates:** Range from 0% to several percentage points (varies by city)

**Combined Rate Range:** 5.0% to 13.5%

**Examples by Major Jurisdiction:**
| Location | State | Local | Total | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Cameron Parish | 5.0% | 0.0% | 5.0% | Lowest in state (no local tax) |
| Monroe | 5.0% | 8.5% | 13.5% | Highest in state |
| Sterlington (Ouachita Parish) | 5.0% | 7.95% | 12.95% | Second highest |
| New Orleans (Orleans Parish) | 5.0% | ~5.0% | ~10.0% | Major metro area |
| Baton Rouge (East Baton Rouge) | 5.0% | ~4.5% | ~9.5% | State capital |
| Jefferson Parish | 5.0% | ~5.0% | ~10.0% | Major parish |

**Average Combined Rate:** Approximately 9.5%

**Critical Note:** Louisiana uses **DOMICILE-BASED TAXATION**, meaning the tax rate is determined by the **buyer's home parish**, NOT the dealer's location. This is unique among U.S. states.

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT** (100% deduction, no cap)

Louisiana provides a complete trade-in credit with no limitations. The trade-in value is fully deducted from the purchase price before calculating sales tax.

#### How It Works
1. Trade-in value is subtracted from vehicle purchase price
2. Sales tax calculated on **net difference** (purchase price minus trade-in)
3. Credit applies to **BOTH state and local taxes** (unlike some states)
4. No cap or limit on trade-in value

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:               -$10,000
Net Taxable Amount:            $20,000

State Tax (5%):                $1,000
Local Tax (4.5%):              $900
Total Tax Due:                 $1,900
```

**Legal Basis:**
- Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Tax Publication (LDR 20164)
- The value of the trade-in vehicle is NOT subject to sales tax
- Trade-in value is deducted from the purchase price before tax calculation

**Requirements:**
- Applies to both state and local taxes
- No cap or limit on trade-in value
- Trade-in must be applied at time of purchase
- Works for both new and used vehicle purchases

---

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** (rebates reduce taxable price)

Louisiana treats manufacturer rebates, incentives, and factory cash-back offers as NON-TAXABLE. Rebates reduce the purchase price before sales tax is calculated.

**How It Works:**
- Factory rebates are NOT taxable
- Manufacturer incentives reduce the taxable base
- Factory-to-dealer cash incentives passed to buyer are non-taxable
- Manufacturer loyalty bonuses are non-taxable
- Special financing incentives are non-taxable

**Tax Calculation:**
Sales tax is calculated on the **NET SELLING PRICE** after all manufacturer rebates, incentives, and discounts are applied.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $46,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$4,000
Net Purchase Price:            $42,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:                  $42,000 (NOT $46,000)
Sales Tax @ 9%:                $3,780
```

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Connecticut:** Manufacturer rebates ARE taxable (tax on full pre-rebate price)
- **Alabama:** Manufacturer rebates ARE taxable
- **Louisiana:** Manufacturer rebates are NON-taxable (reduces tax base)

**Source:** Louisiana Sales Tax Handbook; Find The Best Car Price LA Guide (2025)

---

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** (same as manufacturer rebates)

Louisiana treats dealer rebates, discounts, and incentives the same as manufacturer rebates - they reduce the taxable purchase price.

**How It Works:**
- Dealer discounts are NOT taxable
- Dealer cash incentives reduce the taxable base
- Dealer-sponsored rebates reduce the purchase price
- Negotiated price reductions reduce the taxable base

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $35,000
Dealer Discount:               -$3,000
Selling Price:                 $32,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:                  $32,000
Sales Tax @ 9%:                $2,880
```

---

### 1.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

#### Taxability
**LIKELY TAXABLE** (as part of cash price)

The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles documentation indicates that "Sales/Use tax will be assessed on the sale price of the vehicle, in addition to the applicable, taxable items listed on the dealer invoice or bill of sale." This suggests doc fees shown on the invoice are likely included in the taxable base.

**Conservative Approach:** Treat as taxable until verified with Louisiana Department of Revenue.

#### Cap Amount
**MAXIMUM CAP: $425**

Louisiana Revised Statute 6:969.18 allows sellers to charge:
- Up to $35 for documentation fee for services performed in documenting a motor vehicle credit transaction (by credit extender)
- Up to $425 maximum for seller documentation and compliance fee

**What Doc Fees Cover:**
- Credit investigation
- Compliance with federal and state law
- Preparation of documents to perfect or satisfy a lien
- Titling functions
- Other functions incidental to the sale

**Example:**
```
Doc Fee:                       $425
Combined Rate:                 9%
Tax on Doc Fee:                $38.25
```

**Source:** Louisiana RS 6:969.18; Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles Publication

---

### 1.6 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** **LIKELY EXEMPT** (regulated as insurance, verify)

Vehicle Service Contracts (VSCs) are likely exempt from Louisiana sales tax because they are regulated as "Vehicle Mechanical Breakdown Insurers" under Louisiana law.

**Legal Framework:**
- Louisiana regulates VSCs as insurance products
- Must be licensed by Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance
- Louisiana generally does NOT tax insurance premiums
- Services are only taxable if specifically enumerated in the law

**Tax Treatment:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Sales Tax @ 9%:                $2,700
VSC Price:                     $2,500
VSC Tax:                       $0 (LIKELY EXEMPT)
Total:                         $35,200
```

**RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at 855-307-3893 or sales.inquiries@la.gov for definitive guidance on VSC taxability.

**Source:** Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act

---

### 1.7 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** **LIKELY EXEMPT** (classified as insurance product, verify)

GAP insurance is likely exempt from Louisiana sales tax because it is treated as an insurance-type product.

**Legal Framework:**
- GAP is regulated under Louisiana RS 6:969.51
- Required to be offered to consumers as optional purchase
- Treated as insurance-type product
- Insurance premiums are generally exempt from Louisiana sales tax

**Tax Treatment:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Sales Tax @ 9%:                $2,700
GAP Insurance:                 $895
GAP Tax:                       $0 (LIKELY EXEMPT)
Total:                         $33,595
```

**RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at 855-307-3893 or sales.inquiries@la.gov for definitive guidance, especially if GAP is offered as a waiver rather than insurance.

**Source:** Louisiana RS 6:969.51; Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act

### 1.8 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (all accessories sold with motor vehicle)

Accessories added to vehicles are subject to Louisiana sales tax at the same combined state and local rate as the vehicle.

**What Is Taxable:**
- Aftermarket accessories installed by dealer
- Add-on equipment (running boards, tonneau covers, roof racks, etc.)
- Electronics (stereos, navigation, security systems)
- Paint protection, fabric protection, window tinting
- Any other accessories sold as part of the vehicle purchase

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Accessories:                   $1,500
Total Sale Price:              $29,500
─────────────────────────────
Sales Tax @ 9%:                $2,655
```

**Source:** Louisiana RS 47:302

---

### 1.9 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** (it's debt, not part of purchase price)

Negative equity (underwater trade-ins) can be rolled into the new loan, but the unpaid balance from the trade-in is NOT subject to sales tax.

**How It Works:**
- Negative equity is the difference between trade-in value and trade-in payoff
- This amount is added to the amount financed
- Negative equity is DEBT, not a purchase of taxable property
- Sales tax is based on the vehicle purchase price, NOT the financed amount

**Example - Underwater Trade-In:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $30,000
Trade-In Value:                $8,000
Trade-In Payoff:               $12,000
Negative Equity:               $4,000

Tax Calculation:
Purchase Price:                $30,000
Less Trade-In Value:           -$8,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:                $22,000
Sales Tax @ 9%:                $1,980

Financing:
Net Vehicle Cost:              $22,000
Sales Tax:                     $1,980
Negative Equity:               $4,000
─────────────────────────────
Amount Financed:               $27,980

(The $4,000 negative equity is added to the loan but is NOT taxed)
```

**Legal Basis:**
Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (RS Title 6, Chapter 10-B) explicitly recognizes "negative equity trade-in allowances" as part of the "amount financed" in the principal balance subject to finance charges. This is DEBT, not a purchase of taxable property.

---

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION**

Louisiana taxes vehicle leases based on the MONTHLY PAYMENT amount, NOT on the total capitalized cost upfront.

**Legal Framework:**

**Louisiana RS 47:321(B) - Lease Tax:**
Levies tax at the rate of 1% of the monthly lease or rental price paid by a lessee, or contracted or agreed to be paid by a lessee to the owner of the tangible personal property.

**Louisiana RS 47:321.1 - Additional Lease Tax:**
Levies an additional tax at the rate of 0.45% using the same calculation methodology.

**Combined Lease Tax Rates:**
- State lease tax: 1.0%
- Additional state lease tax: 0.45%
- **Total state lease tax: 1.45%**
- Plus local parish/municipal taxes (varies by buyer's domicile)

**What Is Taxed:**
The tax is calculated on the MONTHLY OR PERIODIC LEASE PAYMENT that the lessee pays to the lessor. This includes:
- Depreciation component
- Finance/rent charge component
- Any other charges included in the periodic payment

**Example:**
```
Monthly Lease Payment:         $400
State Lease Tax (1.45%):       $5.80
Local Lease Tax (~5.93%):      $23.70
─────────────────────────────
Total Tax per Payment:         $29.50 (@ 7.375% combined)
Total Monthly Payment:         $429.50
```

**Transportation Trust Fund:**
Louisiana RS 48:77 dedicates the sales tax collections from motor vehicle leases or rentals to the **Transportation Trust Fund**.

**Reporting Requirement:**
Louisiana Department of Revenue Emergency Rule LAC 61:III.1511 requires dealers that collect sales tax on motor vehicle leases or rentals to file electronically using **Form R-1029E** (Electronic Sales Tax Return).

**Source:** Louisiana RS 47:321(B); Louisiana RS 47:321.1; Louisiana RS 48:77

---

### 2.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** **UNCLEAR** (verification needed)

Louisiana law does not explicitly address whether capitalized cost reductions (cap cost reductions) on vehicle leases are subject to tax at signing.

**What is Cap Cost Reduction:**
A capitalized cost reduction is the sum of:
- Cash down payment
- Trade-in allowance
- Rebates

These amounts are subtracted from the gross capitalized cost, resulting in the adjusted capitalized cost.

**General State Practice:**
In MOST states, when you make a down payment (cap cost reduction) on an auto lease, you are charged state and local sales tax on the down payment amount AT SIGNING.

**Louisiana-Specific Guidance:**
No specific Louisiana Department of Revenue guidance or statutes found explicitly stating whether cap cost reductions are taxed upfront.

**CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:** Flag for verification.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at 855-307-3893 or sales.inquiries@la.gov for definitive guidance.

**Source:** Louisiana RS 9:3306

---

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **UNCLEAR** (verification needed)

Louisiana law provides a FULL trade-in credit for vehicle PURCHASES, but the application of trade-in credits to vehicle LEASES is not explicitly addressed in available sources.

**Purchase Trade-In Credit:**
On purchases, Louisiana allows the full trade-in value to be deducted from the purchase price before calculating sales tax (both state and local).

**Lease Trade-In Application:**
When a trade-in is used on a lease, it typically serves as a capitalized cost reduction. The trade-in value is applied to reduce the gross capitalized cost.

**Comparison to Other States:**
Many states that offer trade-in credits on purchases also extend the benefit to leases, either by:
- Exempting the trade-in value from upfront taxation, or
- Reducing the amount subject to monthly payment tax

However, treatment varies significantly by state.

**CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:** Follow retail rule (full credit) until verified.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Contact Louisiana Department of Revenue at 855-307-3893 or sales.inquiries@la.gov for verification.

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** Louisiana provides **RECIPROCAL CREDIT** for sales tax paid to other states

Louisiana GRANTS A CREDIT against its sales tax to residents who paid a similar tax on the purchase of a motor vehicle in another state, IF that state allows a credit for taxes paid in Louisiana.

**Key Rules:**

**Reciprocity Requirement:**
The other state must offer a similar credit to Louisiana residents. This is a RECIPROCAL system.

**Credit Scope:**
- Credit is granted on a RATE-TO-RATE basis, not dollar-to-dollar
- The credit applies to the **STATE TAX ONLY (5%)**, not to parish and municipality taxes
- Applicants are allowed credit for the FULL RATE of sales or use tax paid in the other state

**Application:**
The credit applies when:
1. A Louisiana resident purchases a vehicle in another state
2. The resident paid sales tax to that other state
3. The other state offers reciprocal credit to Louisiana residents
4. The vehicle is titled or registered in Louisiana

**Example:**
```
Louisiana resident buys car in Texas and pays 6.25% Texas sales tax
If Texas offers reciprocal credit to Louisiana residents:
  - Buyer receives credit for the full Texas tax against Louisiana's 5% state tax
  - Buyer would still owe Louisiana LOCAL TAXES (parish/municipal)

Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Texas Sales Tax Paid (6.25%):  $1,875
Louisiana State Tax (5%):      $1,500
Credit for Texas Tax:          $1,500 (limited to LA state tax)
Additional LA State Tax Due:   $0
Louisiana Local Taxes Due:     ~$1,350 (@ 4.5% local rate)
Total Louisiana Tax Due:       $1,350
```

**Military Exception:**
Military personnel are EXEMPT from payment of use tax on motor vehicles imported into Louisiana while on active duty, providing they have proof that sales tax was previously paid on their vehicle in one of the 50 states.

### 3.2 New Resident Use Tax Cap (Effective January 1, 2025)

**Policy:** **$90 MAXIMUM USE TAX** for qualifying new residents

For qualifying vehicles registered on or after January 1, 2025, the use tax owed on a motor vehicle registered by a new resident of Louisiana CANNOT EXCEED $90.

**Requirements to Qualify for $90 Cap:**
All of the following conditions must be met:
1. The vehicle is primarily used for **PERSONAL PURPOSES**
2. The vehicle was previously registered in the name of the new resident in any other state OR was previously leased to the new resident in another state
3. The vehicle is registered **WITHIN 90 DAYS** of being brought into Louisiana

**Credit Interaction:**
If the credits granted for taxes paid in another state reduce the use tax to LESS THAN $90, the taxpayer owes that lower amount.

**Fair Market Value Basis:**
A use tax is due on the FAIR MARKET VALUE of a motor vehicle brought into Louisiana by a new resident who previously registered the vehicle in another state or a foreign country.

**Example:**
```
New Louisiana Resident Scenario:
Vehicle Fair Market Value:     $25,000
Normal Louisiana Use Tax (9%): $2,250
New Resident Cap:              $90
───────────────────────────
Tax Due:                       $90 (if qualified)
```

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 Domicile-Based Taxation

**Unique Feature:** Louisiana bases the tax rate on the **DOMICILE OF THE PURCHASER**, not the location of the seller.

This means a buyer pays the tax rate of their home parish, regardless of where they purchase the vehicle.

**How It Differs from Other States:**
Most states use "destination-based" or "origin-based" taxation:
- **Destination-based:** Tax rate based on where vehicle will be registered
- **Origin-based:** Tax rate based on dealer location
- **Louisiana:** Tax rate based on buyer's home parish (domicile)

**Impact:**
- A buyer from Monroe (13.5% rate) pays that rate even if buying from a Cameron Parish dealer
- A buyer from Cameron Parish (5% rate) pays that rate even if buying in Monroe
- Dealers must determine and collect tax based on buyer's domicile, not their own location

---

### 4.2 Different Rates for Purchases vs. Leases

**Unique Feature:** Louisiana has significantly different tax rates for purchases vs. leases

**Purchase Rate:**
- State: 5.0%
- Local: 0% to 7.0%
- Combined: 5.0% to 13.5%

**Lease Rate:**
- State: 1.45% (1% + 0.45%)
- Local: Same local rates as purchases
- Combined: 1.45% to 8.45%
