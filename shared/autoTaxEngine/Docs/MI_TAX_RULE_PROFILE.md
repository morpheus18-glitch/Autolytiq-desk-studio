## Executive Summary

Michigan has a **6% flat state sales/use tax** with **NO local tax additions** for vehicles. The state uses a unique **capped trade-in credit** system: $11,000 maximum OR the agreed-upon trade-in value, **whichever is LESS**. Unlike most states, Michigan caps trade-in credits for motor vehicles while providing **NO LIMIT** for recreational vehicles traded for RVs. Manufacturer rebates are **TAXABLE** (tax calculated before rebate applied), and service contracts/GAP are **NOT TAXABLE** if optional and separately itemized.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- 6% flat state rate (no local additions)
- Trade-in credit: $11,000 cap OR agreed value (whichever is less)
- Recreational vehicles: NO trade-in cap when trading RV for RV
- Manufacturer rebates: TAXABLE (exception for employee discounts)
- Dealer incentives: TAXABLE
- Doc fee: TAXABLE (capped at $260 or 5% of price, whichever is less)
- Service contracts/GAP: NOT TAXABLE if optional and separate
- Lease taxation: MONTHLY (6% use tax on each payment)
- Lease trade-in credit: NONE (statute doesn't extend to leases)
- Cap reduction on leases: TAXABLE (treated as "first payment")
- Reciprocity: YES (collect lesser of MI 6% or buyer's home state rate)

## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 Tax Rates (Current 2025)

#### State Rate
- **Sales/Use Tax:** 6.0% (flat rate)
- **Type:** Sales tax on sales, use tax on out-of-state purchases
- **Legal Basis:** Michigan Compiled Laws 205.51-205.78

#### Local Rates
**NONE** - Michigan has NO local sales tax on vehicles

Michigan is one of the few states with a flat state-only rate for vehicles. There are no county, city, or special district taxes on vehicle purchases.

#### Total Rate
- **Statewide:** 6.0% (consistent across all jurisdictions)
- **Example:** Detroit, Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor all charge 6%

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value (assume $8K):   -$8,000
Taxable Base:                  $22,000

Sales Tax (6%):                $1,320
Total Tax:                     $1,320
```

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **CAPPED** - $11,000 cap OR agreed-upon value (whichever is LESS)

#### How It Works
Michigan uses "sales tax on the difference" - trade-in value is deducted from the purchase price before calculating tax.

**Trade-In Cap Formula:**
```
Trade-In Credit = MINIMUM($11,000, Agreed Trade-In Value)
```

**Example 1: Trade-In Below Cap**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $35,000
Trade-In Value:                $9,000
Taxable Base:                  $26,000 ($35,000 - $9,000)
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,560
```

**Example 2: Trade-In Above Cap**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $50,000
Trade-In Value:                $15,000
Trade-In Credit (capped):      $11,000 (limited by cap)
Taxable Base:                  $39,000 ($50,000 - $11,000)
Sales Tax (6%):                $2,340

Without cap, tax would be:
$35,000 × 6% = $2,100
Additional tax due to cap:     $240
```

**Legal Basis:**
- Michigan Vehicle Code
- Michigan Form 485 (2025) - Instructions for Vehicle Dealers

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The cap applies to the LESSER of:
1. $11,000 statutory maximum, OR
2. Agreed-upon trade-in value

#### Recreational Vehicle Exception

**NO CAP for Recreational Vehicles**

When trading a recreational vehicle (RV) for another recreational vehicle, there is NO limit on the trade-in credit.

**Recreational Vehicle Definition (Michigan Vehicle Code):**
- Motor homes
- Travel trailers
- Fifth-wheel trailers
- Campers

**Example:**
```
RV Purchase Price:             $80,000
RV Trade-In Value:             $25,000
Trade-In Credit (RV):          $25,000 (NO CAP)
Taxable Base:                  $55,000
Sales Tax (6%):                $3,300
```

**Requirement:** Both the trade-in and the new purchase must be recreational vehicles to qualify for the unlimited trade-in credit.

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** - Tax calculated on full price BEFORE rebate applied

#### Tax Treatment
Michigan taxes the full purchase price before manufacturer rebates. The rebate is applied AFTER tax calculation.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $32,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Customer Net Price:            $29,000

Tax Calculation:
Taxable Base:                  $32,000 (BEFORE rebate)
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,920
Total After Rebate:            $30,920

Customer effectively pays:     $29,000 + $1,920 = $30,920
```

**EXCEPTION - Employee Discount Programs:**

When a manufacturer reimburses a dealer for an employee discount (e.g., GM Employee Pricing, Ford A-Plan), and the manufacturer is directly involved in the reimbursement, the discount may be non-taxable.

**Rationale:** Michigan considers manufacturer rebates as payments made after the sale is complete, not reductions in the purchase price. Therefore, tax applies to the full sale price.

**Source:** Michigan Admin. Code R. 205.22 - Discounts, coupons, and rebates

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (unless true price reduction)

**Two Types:**

1. **Direct Dealer Discounts (Price Reductions):**
   - Dealer lowers advertised price
   - Customer pays reduced amount
   - Tax calculated on reduced price
   - **NOT TAXABLE** (price reduction)

2. **Manufacturer-to-Dealer Incentives:**
   - Manufacturer pays dealer incentive
   - Dealer passes savings to customer
   - Tax calculated on price BEFORE incentive
   - **TAXABLE**

**Example - Direct Dealer Discount:**
```
Advertised Price:              $30,000
Dealer Discount:               -$2,000
Actual Sale Price:             $28,000

Taxable Base:                  $28,000
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,680
```

**Example - Manufacturer-to-Dealer Incentive:**
```
Sale Price:                    $30,000
Manufacturer Dealer Incentive: $2,000 (dealer receives)

Taxable Base:                  $30,000
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,800
Dealer passes $2,000 to customer as rebate AFTER tax
```

### 1.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

#### Taxability
**TAXABLE** - Documentation fees are subject to 6% sales tax

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Doc Fee:                       $260
Total Sale Price:              $28,260

Taxable Base:                  $28,260 (includes doc fee)
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,695.60
```

#### Cap Amount
**CAPPED** - $260 or 5% of cash price, whichever is LESS

**Formula:**
```
Maximum Doc Fee = MINIMUM($260, Cash Price × 5%)
```

**Examples:**
```
Vehicle Price $20,000:
  5% of price = $1,000
  Cap = MINIMUM($260, $1,000) = $260

Vehicle Price $3,000:
  5% of price = $150
  Cap = MINIMUM($260, $150) = $150
```

**Adjustment:** The $260 cap is adjusted every 2 years based on Consumer Price Index (CPI).

**Uniform Application:** Doc fee must be charged uniformly across all transactions (cash, credit, lease).

**Source:** Michigan Dealer Manual Chapter 8; Michigan Form 485 Instructions

### 1.6 Title Fee Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** when separately stated

**Current Title Fee:** $15.00 (standard Michigan title fee)

Title fees are government fees and not subject to sales tax.

### 1.7 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** Service contracts are **NOT TAXABLE** if optional and separately itemized

#### Extended Warranty / Service Contract Sales
- NOT subject to Michigan sales tax if:
  1. Optional (not mandatory)
  2. Separately itemized on purchase agreement
  3. Sold as insurance-type contract

**EXCEPTION - Mandatory or Bundled:**
If a service contract is mandatory or bundled with the vehicle purchase without separate itemization, it may be considered taxable.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Service Contract (VSC):        $2,500 (optional, separate)
Total Purchase:                $32,500

Taxable Base:                  $30,000 (VSC excluded)
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,800
```

**Best Practice:** Clearly itemize VSC as optional on purchase agreement to ensure non-taxable treatment.

**Source:** Michigan Admin. Code R. 205.54; Michigan Dealer Manual Chapter 8

### 1.8 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance is classified as an insurance product and is exempt from Michigan sales/use tax.

**Legal Basis:** Insurance premiums and related services are exempt from Michigan sales tax.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
GAP Insurance:                 $895
Total Purchase:                $30,895

Taxable Base:                  $30,000 (GAP excluded)
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,800
```

### 1.9 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** - Dealer-installed accessories are subject to 6% sales tax

Accessories installed by the dealer and included in the vehicle purchase are taxable.

**Examples:**
- Running boards
- Mud flaps
- Cargo liners
- Window tinting
- Remote starters
- Aftermarket wheels
- Roof racks

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Dealer-Installed Accessories:  $2,000
Total Sale Price:              $30,000

Taxable Base:                  $30,000
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,800
```

### 1.10 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** - Negative equity rolled into loan increases taxable base

When negative equity from a trade-in is rolled into the new vehicle purchase, it is added to the taxable base.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $30,000
Trade-In Value:                $8,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$12,000
Negative Equity:               -$4,000

Calculation:
Purchase Price:                $30,000
Less: Trade-In Credit:         -$8,000 (capped at $11K, so full $8K applies)
Plus: Negative Equity:         +$4,000
Taxable Base:                  $26,000

Sales Tax (6%):                $1,560
Amount Financed:               $27,560
```

**Note:** Negative equity is considered part of the purchase price because it increases the total consideration paid for the new vehicle.

---

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY** - 6% use tax on each monthly lease payment

Michigan applies a 6% use tax to each monthly lease payment as it is made. This is NOT a sales tax, but rather a use tax on the privilege of using the leased vehicle.

**Legal Framework:**
- Michigan use tax statute
- Michigan Admin. Code

### 2.2 Lease Tax Calculation

#### Monthly Payment Tax
Each monthly lease payment is subject to 6% use tax.

**Example:**
```
Base Monthly Payment:          $450.00
Monthly Use Tax (6%):          $27.00
Total Monthly Payment:         $477.00
```

#### Capitalized Cost Reduction (Down Payment)

**TAXABLE** - Cap reduction is treated as a "first payment"

Michigan treats capitalized cost reduction (down payment) as the equivalent of a first payment and subjects it to use tax. The lessor remits this tax.

**Example:**
```
Cap Cost Reduction (Down):     $3,000
Use Tax on Cap Reduction (6%): $180
Total Due at Signing:          $3,180 (before other fees)
```

**Critical Note:** The use tax on cap reduction is remitted by the lessor and is NOT submitted with Form RD-108 (dealer monthly return). It's handled separately as part of the lease inception.

**Source:** Michigan Dealer Manual Chapter 8; Michigan Form 485 Instructions

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **NONE** - Trade-in credit statute does NOT extend to leases

**CRITICAL:** Unlike retail sales, Michigan does NOT provide trade-in credit for lease transactions.

**Legal Rationale:**
- Trade-in credit statute applies to "sales" under sales tax law
- Leases are subject to "use tax," not "sales tax"
- Use tax regulations do not provide for trade-in credit

**Example:**
```
RETAIL SALE (with $10K trade-in):
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Trade-In Credit:               -$10,000
Taxable Base:                  $20,000
Sales Tax (6%):                $1,200

LEASE (with $10K trade-in value applied to cap):
Trade-In:                      $10,000 (reduces cap cost, no tax benefit)
Monthly Payment:               $400
Monthly Use Tax (6%):          $24
Total Monthly:                 $424
```

**Impact:** Customers with trade-ins pay more tax on leases than on retail purchases in Michigan.

**Source:** Michigan Dealer Manual Chapter 8 (Revised January 2023)

### 2.4 Rebate Treatment on Leases

**Policy:** **Follow retail rule** (TAXABLE)

Manufacturer rebates on leases are treated the same as retail: rebates reduce the cap cost but do not reduce the use tax obligation.

### 2.5 Documentation Fee on Leases

**Policy:** **ALWAYS TAXABLE**

Doc fees on leases are subject to 6% use tax, consistent with retail treatment.

**Example:**
```
Doc Fee:                       $260
Use Tax on Doc Fee (6%):       $15.60
Total Doc Fee Cost:            $275.60
```

**Note:** Doc fee tax is typically paid upfront at lease signing.

### 2.6 Fee Taxability on Leases

**Service Contracts and GAP:**

Both service contracts (VSC) and GAP insurance are **NOT TAXABLE** on leases if:
1. Optional (not mandatory)
2. Separately itemized

**Example:**
```
Capitalized Costs:
Vehicle Cap Cost:              $35,000
Service Contract:              $1,800 (NOT taxed, if optional)
GAP Insurance:                 $695 (NOT taxed)
Total Cap Cost:                $37,495

Monthly Payment:               $450 (based on full cap cost)
Monthly Use Tax (6%):          $27 (only on payment, not VSC/GAP)
Total Monthly:                 $477
```

### 2.7 Negative Equity on Leases

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

If negative equity is rolled into a lease (increasing cap cost), it increases the depreciation component, which increases monthly payments, which increases monthly use tax.

**Example:**
```
Base Cap Cost:                 $35,000
Negative Equity:               +$4,000
Total Cap Cost:                $39,000
Residual Value:                $21,000
Depreciation:                  $18,000 (higher due to negative equity)
Monthly Payment:               $550 (higher)
Monthly Use Tax (6%):          $33 (higher)
```

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Reciprocity Policy

**Policy:** Michigan has **RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS** with most states

Michigan dealers collect the LESSER of:
1. Michigan 6% rate, OR
2. Purchaser's home state rate

The tax paid to Michigan is then applied as a credit when the buyer registers the vehicle in their home state.

#### How It Works

**Scenario 1: Home State Rate Higher than Michigan**
```
Buyer's Home State: Illinois (7.25%)
Vehicle Purchase: $30,000
Michigan Tax Collected: $30,000 × 6% = $1,800

When buyer registers in Illinois:
Illinois Tax Due: $30,000 × 7.25% = $2,175
Credit for MI Tax: -$1,800
Additional IL Tax: $375
```

**Scenario 2: Home State Rate Lower than Michigan**
```
Buyer's Home State: North Carolina (3%)
Vehicle Purchase: $30,000
Michigan Tax Collected: $30,000 × 3% = $900 (collect lower rate)

When buyer registers in North Carolina:
NC Tax Due: $900
Credit for MI Tax: $900
Additional NC Tax: $0
```

**Scenario 3: Exempt States (No Vehicle Sales Tax)**
```
Buyer's Home State: Montana, Delaware, Oregon, etc.
Vehicle Purchase: $30,000
Michigan Tax Collected: $0 (exempt state)
```

### 3.2 Exempt States (No Vehicle Sales Tax)

Michigan dealers do NOT collect sales tax for buyers from these states:
- Alaska (AK)
- Delaware (DE)
- Montana (MT)
- New Hampshire (NH)
- New Mexico (NM)
- Oregon (OR)

### 3.3 Non-Reciprocal States

These states do NOT provide reciprocity (impose use tax even if MI sales tax paid):
- Arkansas (AR)
- District of Columbia (DC)
- Georgia (GA)
- Maryland (MD)
- Mississippi (MS)
- Nebraska (NE)
- North Carolina (NC)
- Oklahoma (OK)
- South Carolina (SC)
- South Dakota (SD)
- West Virginia (WV)

**Impact:** Buyers from these states may pay Michigan sales tax AND home state use tax (double taxation).

### 3.4 Documentation Requirements

Michigan dealers must:
1. Document buyer's home state residence
2. Apply correct tax rate (lesser of MI or home state)
3. Provide documentation to buyer showing tax collected
4. Maintain records of out-of-state sales

**Source:** Michigan Form 485 Instructions; Michigan Dealer Manual Chapter 8

## 4. UNIQUE MICHIGAN FEATURES

### 4.1 Capped Trade-In Credit ($11,000)

**Feature:** Michigan caps trade-in credit at $11,000 for motor vehicles

**Why Unique:**
Most states either:
- Provide FULL trade-in credit (no cap), OR
- Provide NO trade-in credit

Michigan's $11,000 cap is unusual and creates a "partial credit" system.

**Impact:**
```
$15,000 Trade-In

State with FULL credit:
  Tax savings: $15,000 × 6% = $900 savings

Michigan (with cap):
  Tax savings: $11,000 × 6% = $660 savings
  Lost savings: $240
```

### 4.2 RV Trade-In Exception (No Cap)

**Feature:** NO limit on trade-in credit when trading RV for RV

This creates a dual system:
- Motor vehicles: $11,000 cap
- Recreational vehicles: Unlimited credit

**Example:**
```
Motor Vehicle Trade:
Trade-In Value: $20,000
Credit Applied: $11,000 (capped)
Tax Impact: $9,000 still taxable

RV Trade:
Trade-In Value: $20,000
Credit Applied: $20,000 (NO CAP)
Tax Impact: Full credit applied
```

### 4.3 No Local Taxes (State-Only System)

**Feature:** 6% flat statewide rate with no local additions

**Why Unique:**
Michigan is one of the few states with a consistent statewide rate. Most states have local county/city taxes that vary by jurisdiction.

**Benefit:**
- Simple calculation (always 6%)
- No jurisdiction lookup required
- Consistent tax burden statewide

**Comparison:**
```
Michigan (Detroit):     6.0%
Michigan (Grand Rapids): 6.0%
Michigan (Ann Arbor):   6.0%

vs.

Colorado (Denver):      8.81%
Colorado (Aurora):      8.75%
Colorado (Boulder):     8.99%
```

### 4.4 Manufacturer Rebate Taxation

**Feature:** Rebates are TAXABLE (tax on full MSRP before rebate)

**Impact:**
```
$35,000 MSRP
$5,000 Manufacturer Rebate
$30,000 Customer Pays

Michigan Tax: $35,000 × 6% = $2,100

State that doesn't tax rebates:
Tax: $30,000 × 6% = $1,800

Additional tax in Michigan: $300
```

### 4.5 Lease Trade-In Exclusion

**Feature:** NO trade-in credit for leases (statute doesn't extend to leases)

**Why Unique:**
Most states apply trade-in credit to both sales and leases. Michigan specifically excludes leases from the trade-in credit statute.

**Impact:**
Customers with significant trade-in equity are incentivized to purchase rather than lease in Michigan.

### 4.6 Doc Fee Dual Cap ($260 or 5%)

**Feature:** Doc fee capped at LESSER of $260 or 5% of price

**Why Unique:**
Most states either:
- Have a flat dollar cap, OR
- Have no cap at all

Michigan's dual cap ensures small-price vehicles aren't hit with disproportionate doc fees.

**Example:**
```
$50,000 Vehicle:
  5% = $2,500
  Cap = $260 (lesser)

$3,000 Vehicle:
  5% = $150
  Cap = $150 (lesser)
```

### 4.7 Service Contracts and GAP Non-Taxability

**Feature:** VSC and GAP are NOT taxable if optional and separate

**Why Notable:**
Michigan treats these as insurance-type products, exempting them from sales tax. Many states tax these backend products.

**Savings:**
```
VSC: $2,500
GAP: $895
Total: $3,395

Michigan Tax: $0 (exempt)

State that taxes backend products:
Tax: $3,395 × 6% = $203.70
```

- [ ] GAP insurance - amount

### 6.2 Calculation Logic

#### RETAIL PURCHASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Base Purchase Price
  Vehicle_Price
  + Accessories
  + Doc_Fee
  + Negative_Equity
  = Base_Price

STEP 2: Apply Trade-In Credit (Capped)
  IF Vehicle_Type = "Recreational Vehicle" AND Trade_Type = "RV for RV"
    Trade_Credit = Trade_In_Value (NO CAP)
  ELSE
    Trade_Credit = MINIMUM(11000, Trade_In_Value)

  Taxable_Base = Base_Price - Trade_Credit

STEP 3: Calculate Sales Tax (Rebates DO NOT Reduce Base)
  Sales_Tax = Taxable_Base × 0.06

STEP 4: Apply Manufacturer Rebate (AFTER tax)
  Final_Amount = Taxable_Base + Sales_Tax - Manufacturer_Rebate

STEP 5: Add Non-Taxable Items
  VSC (if optional/separate)
  GAP (if separate)
  Title_Fee
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $32,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000 (applied AFTER tax)
Accessories:                   $1,500
Doc Fee:                       $260
Trade-In Value:                $12,000
Negative Equity:               $0

Step 1: Base Price
  $32,000 + $1,500 + $260 = $33,760

Step 2: Trade-In Credit
  MINIMUM($11,000, $12,000) = $11,000
  Taxable Base: $33,760 - $11,000 = $22,760

Step 3: Sales Tax
  $22,760 × 6% = $1,365.60

Step 4: Apply Rebate
  $22,760 + $1,365.60 - $3,000 = $21,125.60

Customer Total Due: $21,125.60
```

#### LEASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Upfront Use Tax on Cap Reduction
  Cap_Reduction_Tax = Cap_Reduction × 0.06

STEP 2: Calculate Doc Fee Use Tax (Upfront)
  Doc_Fee_Tax = Doc_Fee × 0.06

STEP 3: Calculate Monthly Use Tax
  Monthly_Tax = Monthly_Payment × 0.06

STEP 4: Calculate Total Monthly Payment
  Total_Monthly = Monthly_Payment + Monthly_Tax

STEP 5: Add Non-Taxable Items (if applicable)
  Service_Contract (VSC) - NOT taxed if optional
  GAP - NOT taxed
  Title_Fee - NOT taxed
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Cap Cost Reduction:            $3,000
Doc Fee:                       $260
Base Monthly Payment:          $450
Lease Term:                    36 months
Service Contract:              $1,800 (optional)
GAP:                           $695

Upfront Costs:
  Cap Reduction Tax: $3,000 × 6% = $180
  Doc Fee Tax: $260 × 6% = $15.60
  Service Contract: $1,800 (NOT taxed)
  GAP: $695 (NOT taxed)
  Title Fee: $15 (NOT taxed)
  Total Due at Signing: $5,765.60

Monthly Payment:
  Base Payment: $450.00
  Monthly Use Tax: $27.00
  Total Monthly: $477.00
```

### 6.3 Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

```

#### Edge Case 4: Out-of-State Buyer (Lower Rate)
```
Buyer from North Carolina (3%)
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000

  GA Tax Due: $30,000 × 6% = $1,800
  Credit for MI Tax: $0 (no reciprocity)
  Total Taxes Paid: $3,600 (double taxation)
```
