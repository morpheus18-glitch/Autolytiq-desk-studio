## Executive Summary

Hawaii uses a unique **GET (General Excise Tax)** system instead of traditional sales tax. GET is a tax on the **privilege of doing business** imposed on the seller (but passed through to buyers). The effective rate is **4.5%** (4% base + 0.5% county surcharge), with a maximum pass-on rate of **4.712%** due to pyramiding. Hawaii provides **NO trade-in credit** - tax is paid on the full purchase price regardless of trade-in value. Both **service contracts and GAP are TAXABLE** at the GET rate. Hawaii provides **limited reciprocity** with credit for taxes paid elsewhere, capped at Hawaii's use tax amount.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- GET system (4.5% effective) - NOT traditional sales tax
- Tax on seller's gross receipts (passed to buyer)
- NO trade-in credit (tax on full purchase price)
- Maximum pass-on rate of 4.712% (accounts for tax-on-tax pyramiding)
- Service contracts TAXABLE at 4%/4.5% (when sold by dealer)
- GAP TAXABLE at 4%/4.5% (when sold by dealer)
- Manufacturer and dealer rebates are TAXABLE
- County surcharges: 0.5% in all counties through 2030
- Lease taxation: Monthly payments at 4%/4.5%
- Limited reciprocity (credit for prior tax, capped at HI amount)
- No depreciation allowed if vehicle brought within 90 days of purchase

## 1. GENERAL EXCISE TAX (GET) SYSTEM

### 1.1 GET Overview

**What is GET?**
GET (General Excise Tax) is Hawaii's unique alternative to traditional sales tax. It is:
- A tax on the **privilege of doing business** (not a sales tax on buyers)
- Imposed on the **seller's gross receipts**
- Typically **passed through** to the customer
- Applied to nearly all business transactions (goods, services, rentals)

**Critical Distinction:**
Unlike a sales tax (tax on the buyer), GET is legally a tax on the seller. However, Hawaii law allows sellers to "pass on" or "visibly pass on" the GET to customers.

**Why It Matters:**
- GET applies more broadly than sales tax
- Allows tax-on-tax (pyramiding) effect
- Different rates for different business activities
- Nearly universal application

**Legal Basis:**
- Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 237 - General Excise Tax Law
- Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 238 - Use Tax Law
- Hawaii Administrative Rules Title 18, Chapter 237

### 1.2 GET Rates

#### Base Rate
**4.0%** - Base General Excise Tax rate for retail, services, and most business activities

#### County Surcharge
**0.5%** - All four counties impose a 0.5% surcharge (as of 2025)

**County Surcharge Schedule:**
| County | Surcharge | Effective Date | Expiration Date |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Honolulu** | 0.5% | January 1, 2007 | December 31, 2030 |
| **Hawaii** | 0.5% | January 1, 2020 | December 31, 2030 |
| **Maui** | 0.5% | January 1, 2024 | December 31, 2030 |
| **Kauai** | 0.5% | January 1, 2019 | December 31, 2030 |

#### Effective Rate
**4.5%** - Total GET rate (4% base + 0.5% county surcharge)

#### Maximum Pass-On Rate
**4.712%** - Maximum rate businesses can legally "pass on" to customers

**Why Higher Than 4.5%?**
The 4.712% rate accounts for the **pyramiding effect** - since GET is imposed on gross receipts, the seller must pay GET on the GET amount itself (tax-on-tax).

**Calculation:**
```
If seller wants to collect $100 after GET:
Amount charged to customer:  $100 / (1 - 0.045) = $104.712
GET owed to state:           $104.712 × 0.045 = $4.712
Seller keeps:                $100

Pass-on rate:                4.712%
```

### 1.3 GET Rate Schedule (By Activity)

Hawaii GET applies different rates to different business activities:

| Activity | GET Rate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Retail sales** | 4.0% | Most vehicle sales |
| **Services** | 4.0% | Most services |
| **Wholesaling** | 0.5% | Manufacturing, producing |
| **Insurance commissions** | 0.15% | Insurance agent commissions |

**For Vehicle Sales:**
- Dealers pay 4% (or 4.5% with county surcharge) on gross receipts
- Typically pass on 4.712% to customers

### 1.4 Trade-In Policy

**Policy:** **NONE** - No trade-in credit under Hawaii GET

Hawaii does NOT allow trade-in value to reduce the taxable base. GET is calculated on the **full purchase price** of the new vehicle, regardless of any trade-in.

**Why No Credit:**
GET is a tax on gross receipts/income. The dealer's gross income includes the full sale price of the new vehicle. When the trade-in is later sold, that sale is excluded from gross income to avoid double taxation.

**Trade-In Handling Methods:**

**Method 1 (Most Common):**
- Dealer reports full new vehicle sale price as gross income
- Pays GET on full sale price
- When trade-in is later resold, that sale is EXCLUDED from gross income
- Avoids double taxation (GET paid once on vehicle's full value)

**Method 2 (Less Common):**
- Dealer reports net sale price (purchase minus trade-in) as gross income
- Pays GET on net amount
- When trade-in is resold, reports full resale price as gross income
- Same total GET paid, different timing

**For Buyers:**
Regardless of method, buyers pay GET on the **full purchase price** with NO credit for trade-in value.

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $35,000
Trade-In Value:                $12,000
Customer Net Payment:          $23,000

GET Base (Method 1):           $35,000 (full purchase price)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,649.20

No credit for trade-in value
Customer pays $23,000 + $1,649.20 = $24,649.20
```

**Legal Basis:**
- Hawaii Revised Statutes § 237-3 - "Gross income" definition
- HAR § 18-237-13-02.09 - Motor vehicle dealers

**Comparison to Sales Tax States:**
Most states allow full or partial trade-in credit. Hawaii's no-credit policy increases effective tax burden.

### 1.5 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** - Manufacturer rebates do NOT reduce GET base

#### Tax Treatment
Under Hawaii GET, rebates are taxable:
- GET is calculated on price **before** rebates are applied
- Dealer's gross receipts include full price before manufacturer incentives
- Rebates applied AFTER GET calculation

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $32,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$4,000
Customer Pays:                 $28,000

GET Base:                      $32,000 (full price before rebate)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,507.84

Customer Final Payment:        $28,000 + $1,507.84 = $29,507.84
Effective tax on net:          5.39% ($1,507.84 / $28,000)
```

**Why Taxable:**
GET is based on gross income/receipts without deductions for rebates or incentives provided to customers.

### 1.6 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** Dealer rebates are TAXABLE (same as manufacturer rebates)

Dealer incentives and rebates follow the same treatment:
- GET calculated on purchase price before dealer rebates
- Customer receives rebate after GET is paid
- No reduction to GET base

### 1.7 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

#### Taxability
**TAXABLE** - Documentation fees are subject to GET at 4%/4.5% rate

Doc fees are part of the dealer's gross receipts from the sale and subject to GET.

#### Cap Amount
**NO CAP** - Hawaii does not impose a statutory limit on dealer documentation fees

- **Average Doc Fee:** Varies by dealer ($200-$500 range)
- Dealers may set their own documentation fees
- Doc fees must be disclosed to buyers

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Doc Fee:                       $300
Subtotal:                      $30,300
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,427.74
Total:                         $31,727.74
```

### 1.8 Title and Registration Fees

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** - Government fees exempt from GET

**Current Fees:**
- **Title/Registration:** Varies by vehicle type and value
- **Safety Check:** $12 (annual)
- **License Plates:** Varies

Government fees are NOT subject to GET.

### 1.9 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** Service contracts are **TAXABLE** at 4%/4.5% when sold by dealer

**CRITICAL:** Hawaii DOES tax service contracts sold by dealers

Extended warranties and service contracts sold with vehicles ARE subject to GET at the 4% (or 4.5% with county surcharge) rate as part of the dealer's gross receipts.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Service Contract:              $2,500
Subtotal:                      $30,500
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,437.16
Total:                         $31,937.16

Service contract adds ~$118 to GET
```

**Legal Basis:**
Service contracts sold by dealers are part of gross receipts subject to GET at the 4%/4.5% rate.

**Note:** If a separate insurance company sells the service contract, insurance commission rate (0.15%) may apply instead, but dealer-sold contracts typically use the 4%/4.5% retail rate.

### 1.10 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** GAP is **TAXABLE** at 4%/4.5% when sold by dealer

**CRITICAL:** Hawaii DOES tax GAP sold by dealers

GAP insurance sold by dealers as part of vehicle transactions is subject to GET.

**Rate Complexity:**
- **Insurance commissions:** 0.15% GET rate
- **Dealer retail sales:** 4%/4.5% GET rate

When dealers sell GAP as part of vehicle transaction, it's typically treated as part of gross receipts at the 4%/4.5% rate.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
GAP Coverage:                  $795
Subtotal:                      $30,795
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,450.66
Total:                         $32,245.66
```

### 1.11 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** Dealer-installed accessories are TAXABLE at GET rate

#### Accessories Purchased WITH Vehicle
**Included in GET base** if sold as part of vehicle

- Dealer-installed accessories that are part of the vehicle sale price are included in GET calculation
- Includes: aftermarket wheels, running boards, audio systems, etc.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $32,000
Accessories (included):        +$3,000
Total Sale Price:              $35,000
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,649.20
Total:                         $36,649.20
```

### 1.12 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** Negative equity is **TAXABLE** under GET

#### Treatment
Negative equity rolled into the vehicle purchase increases the total amount financed and is subject to GET.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $28,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$14,000
Negative Equity:               $4,000

Total Amount Financed:         $32,000 ($28k + $4k neg equity)
GET Base:                      $32,000 (includes negative equity)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,507.84

Note: No credit for trade-in, negative equity increases base
```

---

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION**

Hawaii leases are taxed using GET on each monthly payment:
- 4% base GET + 0.5% county surcharge = 4.5% effective rate
- Maximum pass-on rate: 4.712%
- Tax applied to each monthly payment
- Lessor (leasing company) is subject to GET on lease income

**Example:**
```
Monthly Lease Payment:         $500
GET @ 4.712%:                  $23.56
Total Monthly Payment:         $523.56

Over 36 months:
Total GET:                     $848.16
```

### 2.2 Cap Cost Reduction on Leases

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions likely NOT taxed upfront

Down payments and cap reductions reduce the capitalized cost, which reduces monthly payments and thus reduces the GET on each payment. The cap reduction itself is typically not taxed separately upfront.

**Note:** Specific Hawaii guidance on cap reduction taxability was limited in research. Conservative approach assumes cap reductions are not taxed upfront but reduce monthly payment (and thus monthly GET).

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $40,000
Cash Down:                     $8,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $32,000

Monthly Payment (without down):    $600
Monthly Payment (with down):       $480

GET without down (4.712% × $600):  $28.27/month
GET with down (4.712% × $480):     $22.62/month
Monthly GET savings:               $5.65

Over 36 months, down payment saves: $203.40 in GET
```

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **NONE** - No trade-in credit on leases

Similar to retail sales, Hawaii does not provide trade-in credit on leases. Trade-in value does not reduce the capitalized cost for GET purposes.

### 2.4 Rebates on Leases

**Policy:** Rebates follow retail rule (TAXABLE)

Manufacturer and dealer rebates applied to leases follow the same treatment as retail - GET is calculated on amounts before rebate adjustments.

### 2.5 Backend Products on Leases

**Policy:** Service contracts and GAP taxable when capitalized

#### Service Contracts (VSC)
**TAXABLE at 4%/4.5%** when capitalized into lease

#### GAP Insurance
**TAXABLE at 4%/4.5%** when capitalized into lease

Both products are subject to GET when included in lease transactions.

### 2.6 Documentation Fee on Leases

**Policy:** Doc fees are **TAXABLE** on leases at 4%/4.5% rate

Doc fees on lease transactions are subject to GET.

### 2.7 Negative Equity on Leases

**Policy:** Negative equity is **TAXABLE** via increased monthly payments

Negative equity rolled into a lease increases the capitalized cost, which increases monthly payments, which increases the monthly GET.

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** Hawaii provides **LIMITED RECIPROCITY** with credit capped at HI use tax amount

Hawaii allows credit for sales or use tax paid to another state when a vehicle purchased elsewhere is brought to Hawaii and registered.

#### Legal Framework
Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 238 - Use Tax Law:
- Credit for sales/use tax paid to another state
- Credit applies to Hawaii use tax (4% or 4.5% with county surcharge)
- Requires proof of tax paid (title, registration, receipt)
- Credit is capped at Hawaii use tax amount

#### How It Works

**Scenario 1: Other State Tax > Hawaii Tax**
If tax paid to another state exceeds Hawaii's use tax, NO additional Hawaii tax is due.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in California:  $30,000
California tax paid (7.25%):      $2,175
Hawaii use tax (4.5%):            $1,350
Credit allowed:                   $1,350 (capped at HI amount)
Additional HI tax due:            $0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Tax < Hawaii Tax**
If tax paid to another state is less than Hawaii's use tax, pay the DIFFERENCE.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Arizona:     $30,000
Arizona tax paid (5.6%):          $1,680
Hawaii use tax (4.5%):            $1,350
Credit allowed:                   $1,350 (capped at HI tax)
Additional HI tax due:            $0

(AZ tax exceeds HI tax, no additional payment)
```

**Scenario 3: No Tax Paid (e.g., Oregon)**
If no tax paid in another state, full Hawaii use tax is due.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Oregon:      $30,000
Oregon tax paid (0%):             $0
Hawaii use tax (4.5%):            $1,350
Credit allowed:                   $0
Additional HI tax due:            $1,350 (full amount)
```

### 3.2 Special Rules

#### 90-Day No Depreciation Window
**CRITICAL:** If vehicle is brought to Hawaii within **90 days** of purchase, no depreciation is allowed on the use tax base.

- Vehicle must be valued at original purchase price
- No reduction for time/mileage between purchase and Hawaii registration
- Prevents tax avoidance through waiting period

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased:             $35,000 (60 days ago)
Current market value:          $33,000 (slight depreciation)
Use tax base:                  $35,000 (original price - within 90 days)
Hawaii use tax (4.5%):         $1,575
```

#### Not All States Reciprocate
**Important:** Not all states recognize Hawaii GET for reciprocity purposes.

Example: Florida does not allow credit for Hawaii GET, but Hawaii allows credit for Florida sales tax.

### 3.3 Documentation Required

**Required Proof:**
- Prior state title showing tax paid
- Registration showing tax paid
- Receipt or invoice showing tax amount
- Documentation that tax was legally imposed

### 3.4 Lease Reciprocity

**Policy:** Same reciprocity treatment for leases

Hawaii provides the same limited reciprocity for lease transactions.

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 GET System (Not Sales Tax)

**Feature:** Hawaii uses GET instead of traditional sales tax

**Why Unique:**
- Tax on **seller's privilege of doing business** (not buyer's purchase)
- Applies to **gross receipts** with minimal deductions
- **Pyramiding allowed** (tax-on-tax)
- Nearly **universal application** (goods, services, rentals)
- Different rates for different business activities

**Comparison to Sales Tax:**
| Aspect | GET (Hawaii) | Traditional Sales Tax |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Who is taxed | Seller (passed to buyer) | Buyer |
| Base | Gross receipts/income | Purchase price |
| Pyramiding | Allowed | Not applicable |
| Application | Nearly universal | Retail goods primarily |
| Rate structure | By business activity | By jurisdiction |

### 4.2 No Trade-In Credit

**Feature:** Hawaii does NOT allow trade-in credit

**Impact:**
```
$30,000 vehicle with $10,000 trade-in:

Most states with trade-in credit:
Tax base:                      $20,000 (net after trade-in)
Tax @ 7%:                      $1,400

Hawaii (no trade-in credit):
GET base:                      $30,000 (full purchase price)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,413.60

Effective tax rate similar, but no credit for trade-in value
```

**Why Notable:** Most states provide at least partial trade-in credit. Hawaii's no-credit policy reflects GET structure (tax on gross receipts).

### 4.3 Pyramiding Effect (4.712% Pass-On Rate)

**Feature:** Maximum pass-on rate exceeds statutory rate

**Why It Happens:**
Because GET is imposed on gross receipts, the seller must pay GET on the GET amount itself.

**Calculation Example:**
```
Seller wants to keep $100 after GET:

Amount to charge:              $104.712
GET owed (4.5% × $104.712):    $4.712
Seller keeps:                  $100

Pass-on rate to customer:      4.712% (not 4.5%)
```

**Why Unique:** This tax-on-tax (pyramiding) effect is specific to excise tax systems like Hawaii's GET.

### 4.4 Service Contracts and GAP Are Taxable

**Feature:** Hawaii taxes F&I products that many states exempt

**Impact:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Service Contract:              $2,500
GAP Coverage:                  $795
Total:                         $33,295
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,569.14

F&I products add ~$155 to GET
```

**Why Notable:** Many states treat service contracts and GAP as insurance products (exempt). Hawaii treats them as taxable gross receipts.

### 4.5 County Surcharges (All Counties Through 2030)

**Feature:** All four Hawaii counties impose 0.5% surcharge through 2030

**Counties:**
- Honolulu (since 2007)
- Hawaii (since 2020)
- Maui (since 2024)
- Kauai (since 2019)

**Sunset Date:** December 31, 2030 (all counties)

**Impact:** After 2030, effective GET rate may decrease if surcharges are not extended.

### 4.6 90-Day No Depreciation Window

**Feature:** Vehicles brought to Hawaii within 90 days valued at original purchase price

**Purpose:** Prevent tax avoidance through waiting periods

**Impact:**
```
Buy vehicle on mainland:       $35,000
Wait 60 days, bring to Hawaii
Current value:                 $33,000
Use tax base:                  $35,000 (within 90 days - no depreciation)
Hawaii use tax:                $1,575 (vs. $1,485 if depreciation allowed)
```

## 5. COUNTY DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 County Surcharge Rates (2025)

All four Hawaii counties impose the same 0.5% surcharge:

| County | Base GET | Surcharge | Total | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Honolulu** | 4.0% | 0.5% | 4.5% | Since 2007 |
| **Hawaii** | 4.0% | 0.5% | 4.5% | Since 2020 |
| **Maui** | 4.0% | 0.5% | 4.5% | Since 2024 |
| **Kauai** | 4.0% | 0.5% | 4.5% | Since 2019 |

**Result:** Uniform 4.5% effective GET rate statewide

### 5.2 No Rate Shopping

All counties have the same total rate (4.5% effective, 4.712% max pass-on). No advantage to purchasing in one county vs. another.

---

## 6. HISTORICAL CHANGES AND TRENDS

### 6.1 County Surcharge Implementation

**Timeline:**
- **2007:** Honolulu County - First to implement 0.5% surcharge
- **2019:** Kauai County - Added 0.5% surcharge
- **2020:** Hawaii County - Added 0.5% surcharge
- **2024:** Maui County - Last to add 0.5% surcharge

**Current Status:** All counties have 0.5% surcharge through 2030

### 6.2 Surcharge Sunset (2030)

**All county surcharges expire December 31, 2030**

**Potential Scenarios:**
1. Surcharges are extended beyond 2030
2. Surcharges expire, rate drops to 4%
3. Surcharges are modified or replaced

**Impact on GET:** If surcharges expire without extension, effective rate would decrease from 4.5% to 4%.

### 6.3 Use Tax Reciprocity

**Stable:** Hawaii has maintained reciprocity policy allowing credit for out-of-state taxes paid

### 6.4 Future Considerations

**Potential Changes to Watch:**
- County surcharge extensions beyond 2030
- Base GET rate adjustments
- Electric vehicle taxation provisions
- Use tax reciprocity modifications

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TAX CALCULATION SYSTEM

### 8.1 Required Data Points

To correctly calculate Hawaii GET/use tax, the system must capture:

**Vehicle Transaction Data:**
- [ ] Vehicle sale/lease price

### 8.2 Calculation Logic

#### GET (RETAIL PURCHASE) CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Gross Sale Price (No Trade-In Credit)
  Gross_Sale_Price = Vehicle_Price
                    + Accessories
                    + Doc_Fee
                    + Service_Contract  (TAXABLE in HI)
                    + GAP_Coverage      (TAXABLE in HI)
                    + Negative_Equity
                    (Do NOT subtract trade-in value)
                    (Do NOT subtract manufacturer/dealer rebates)

STEP 2: Calculate GET
  GET_Rate = 0.04712  (4.712% maximum pass-on rate)
  GET = Gross_Sale_Price × GET_Rate

STEP 3: Calculate Customer Total
  Customer_Payment = (Gross_Sale_Price - Trade_In_Value - Rebates) + GET + Govt_Fees

  Note: Trade-in and rebates reduce what customer pays, but not GET base
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $32,000
Service Contract:              $2,500
GAP Coverage:                  $795
Doc Fee:                       $350
Trade-In Value:                -$12,000 (no credit for GET)
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000 (no credit for GET)

GET Base:                      $35,645 (all items, no deductions)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,679.60

Customer Pays:
  Base prices:                 $35,645
  Less trade-in:               -$12,000
  Less rebate:                 -$3,000
  Subtotal:                    $20,645
  Plus GET:                    +$1,679.60
  Total:                       $22,324.60
```

#### LEASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Adjusted Cap Cost
  (Cap reductions typically not taxed upfront, reduce monthly payment)

STEP 2: Calculate Monthly Payment

STEP 3: Calculate Monthly GET
  Monthly_GET = Monthly_Payment × 0.04712

STEP 4: Calculate Total Monthly Payment
  Total_Monthly = Monthly_Payment + Monthly_GET

STEP 5: Calculate Total Lease GET Over Term
  Total_Lease_GET = Monthly_GET × Lease_Term_Months
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
LEASE TERMS:
Gross Cap Cost:                $38,000
Cash Down:                     $6,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $32,000

Monthly Payment (base):        $480
Monthly GET (4.712%):          $22.62
Total Monthly Payment:         $502.62

36-month term:
Total lease GET:               $814.32
```

#### USE TAX (OUT-OF-STATE PURCHASE) CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Check 90-Day Window
  IF days_since_purchase <= 90:
    Use_Tax_Base = Original_Purchase_Price (no depreciation)
  ELSE:
    Use_Tax_Base = Current_Fair_Market_Value (allow depreciation)

STEP 2: Calculate Hawaii Use Tax
  HI_Use_Tax = Use_Tax_Base × 0.045  (4.5%)

STEP 3: Apply Reciprocity Credit
  IF prior_state_tax_paid > 0:
    Credit = MIN(prior_state_tax_paid, HI_Use_Tax)
    Use_Tax_Due = HI_Use_Tax - Credit
  ELSE:
    Use_Tax_Due = HI_Use_Tax

STEP 4: Calculate Total Due
  Total_Due = Use_Tax_Due + Registration_Fees
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Vehicle purchased in California 45 days ago:
Original Purchase Price:       $30,000
California tax paid (7.25%):   $2,175
Current value:                 $29,000 (slight depreciation)

Use Tax Base:                  $30,000 (within 90 days - no depreciation)
Hawaii Use Tax (4.5%):         $1,350
Credit (capped):               $1,350 (CA tax exceeds HI tax)
Additional HI tax due:         $0
```

### 8.3 Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

#### Edge Case 1: Trade-In (No Credit)
```
Vehicle Price:                 $35,000
Trade-In Value:                $15,000
Customer Net:                  $20,000

GET Base:                      $35,000 (NO trade-in credit)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,649.20

Customer pays $20,000 + $1,649.20 = $21,649.20
Effective rate: 8.25% on net amount customer pays
```

#### Edge Case 2: Manufacturer Rebate (Taxable)
```
MSRP:                          $28,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Customer Pays:                 $25,000

GET Base:                      $28,000 (before rebate)
GET @ 4.712%:                  $1,319.36

Customer pays $25,000 + $1,319.36 = $26,319.36
Effective rate: 5.28% on what customer paid
```

#### Edge Case 3: Out-of-State Purchase Within 90 Days
```
Purchased 60 days ago:         $32,000
Current value:                 $30,500
Arizona tax paid:              $1,792

Use Tax Base:                  $32,000 (within 90 days)
Hawaii Use Tax:                $1,440 (4.5% × $32,000)
Credit:                        $1,440 (AZ tax exceeds HI tax)
Additional HI tax due:         $0
```

### 8.4 Validation Rules

**System should validate/flag:**

1. **Trade-In Credit Applied**
   - Error: Hawaii does NOT allow trade-in credit
   - Recalculate with full purchase price as GET base

2. **Manufacturer/Dealer Rebate Reduces GET Base**
   - Error: Rebates do NOT reduce Hawaii GET base
   - Recalculate with price before rebates

3. **Service Contract or GAP Not in GET Base**
   - Error: Hawaii REQUIRES GET on service contracts and GAP
   - Add to GET base

4. **Use Tax Calculation Within 90 Days Using Depreciated Value**
   - Error: No depreciation allowed within 90 days
   - Use original purchase price as base

5. **GET Rate Not Including County Surcharge**
   - Warning: Verify county surcharge is included (0.5% through 2030)
   - Use 4.712% pass-on rate (includes surcharge effect)
