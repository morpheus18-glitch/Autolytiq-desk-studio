## Tax Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Vehicle Purchase
```
Vehicle Price:           $30,000
Trade-In Value:          $10,000
Doc Fee:                 $599
Service Contract:        $1,500
GAP Waiver:             $695
Accessories:             $1,200

Calculation:
Taxable Base = $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
+ Doc Fee = $599
+ Accessories = $1,200
Taxable Amount = $21,799

Sales Tax (7%) = $21,799 × 0.07 = $1,525.93
VSC (not taxed) = $1,500
GAP (not taxed) = $695

Total Tax: $1,525.93
Total Cost: $20,000 + $599 + $1,500 + $695 + $1,200 + $1,525.93 = $25,519.93
```

### Example 2: Purchase with Manufacturer Rebate
```
Vehicle Price:           $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:     $2,000
Trade-In Value:          $12,000
Doc Fee:                 $599
Extended Warranty:       $2,500

Calculation:
Price after Rebate = $35,000 - $2,000 = $33,000
Taxable Base = $33,000 - $12,000 = $21,000
+ Doc Fee = $599
Taxable Amount = $21,599

Sales Tax (7%) = $21,599 × 0.07 = $1,511.93
Extended Warranty (not taxed) = $2,500

Total Tax: $1,511.93
Total Cost: $21,000 + $599 + $2,500 + $1,511.93 = $25,610.93
```

### Example 3: Luxury Vehicle in Providence
```
Vehicle Price:           $75,000
Trade-In Value:          $30,000
Doc Fee:                 $599
Premium VSC:            $4,000
Accessories:             $5,000

Calculation:
Taxable Base = $75,000 - $30,000 = $45,000
+ Doc Fee = $599
+ Accessories = $5,000
Taxable Amount = $50,599

Sales Tax (7%) = $50,599 × 0.07 = $3,541.93
Premium VSC (not taxed) = $4,000

Total Tax: $3,541.93
Total Cost: $45,000 + $599 + $4,000 + $5,000 + $3,541.93 = $58,140.93
```

## Lease Tax Rules

### Lease Taxation Method
- **Method**: MONTHLY
- **Description**: Tax is calculated and collected on each monthly lease payment at 7%
- **Legal Basis**: RIGL § 44-18-20

### Lease Trade-In Credit
- **Type**: FULL
- **Application**: Trade-in credit reduces the capitalized cost, lowering monthly payments and tax

### Lease Tax Calculation
- 7% tax is applied to the monthly payment amount
- Uniform rate across all Rhode Island jurisdictions
- Cap cost reductions not taxed upfront but reduce monthly payments
- Down payments and cap cost reductions lower monthly tax burden

### Lease Payment Example (36-month lease)
```
Monthly Payment:         $450
Sales Tax (7%):         $31.50

Total Monthly:           $481.50

Over 36 months:
Base Payments:          $16,200
Total Tax:              $1,134
Grand Total:            $17,334
```

### Lease with Trade-In Example
```
Gross Cap Cost:          $40,000
Trade-In Value:          $10,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:       $30,000

Monthly Payment (without trade): $475
Monthly Payment (with trade):    $410
Monthly Tax Savings:             ($475 - $410) × 7% = $4.55

Total Tax Savings (36 months):   $4.55 × 36 = $163.80
```

Additional RI Tax:       $225
```

**Example 2: RI Resident Purchasing in Connecticut**
```
Vehicle Price:           $30,000

RI Tax:                  May be exempt or reduced
CT Tax upon registration: 6.35% = $1,905
(Buyer pays CT tax when registering in Connecticut)
```
