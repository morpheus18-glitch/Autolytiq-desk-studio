# Georgia (GA) Automotive Sales and Lease Taxation Profile

**State:** Georgia
**State Code:** GA
**Document Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

Georgia uses a unique **TAVT (Title Ad Valorem Tax)** system for vehicle purchases instead of traditional sales tax. TAVT is a **one-time 7% tax** paid at title/registration based on fair market value, replacing annual property tax on vehicles. The state provides **full trade-in credit** under TAVT. **Leases are taxed differently** - they use standard 4% state sales tax on monthly payments, NOT TAVT. Georgia provides **limited reciprocity** with credit for taxes paid elsewhere, capped at Georgia's tax amount.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- TAVT system (7%) for retail purchases - NOT traditional sales tax
- One-time tax replaces annual property tax on vehicles
- TAVT base is higher of: purchase price OR DMV assessed value
- Full trade-in credit under TAVT
- Leases use 4% sales tax on monthly payments (different system than retail)
- No local jurisdiction stacking (single state rate for both TAVT and lease tax)
- Manufacturer/dealer rebates are taxable (TAVT calculated before rebates)
- Service contracts and GAP NOT subject to TAVT
- Limited reciprocity (credit for prior tax paid, capped at GA amount)

## 1. TITLE AD VALOREM TAX (TAVT) - RETAIL PURCHASES

### 1.1 TAVT Overview

**What is TAVT?**
TAVT (Title Ad Valorem Tax) is Georgia's unique alternative to sales tax for motor vehicles. It is:
- A **one-time tax** paid when the vehicle is first titled in Georgia
- Based on **fair market value** (higher of purchase price or DMV assessed value)
- **Fixed at 7%** statewide (no local jurisdiction rates)
- A **replacement** for annual property tax (ad valorem tax) on vehicles

**Historical Context:**
- Implemented March 1, 2013
- Replaced previous system of annual property tax (ad valorem) on vehicles
- Simplified tax structure and eliminated annual recurring tax burden
- "Title Ad Valorem Tax" literally means "according to value tax paid at title"

**Legal Basis:**
- Georgia Code Title 48, Chapter 5C - Motor Vehicle Title Ad Valorem Tax
- Georgia Department of Revenue Motor Vehicle Division guidance

### 1.2 TAVT Rate

**Current Rate:** **7.0%** (as of 2024-2025)

- **State TAVT:** 7.0%
- **Local/County Tax:** NONE (TAVT is state-only)
- **No jurisdiction stacking** (unlike traditional sales tax systems)

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Fair Market Value:     $30,000
TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,100
```

**Rate History:**
- March 1, 2013 - June 30, 2013: 6.5%
- July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2018: 6.75%
- July 1, 2018 - present: 7.0%

### 1.3 TAVT Base Calculation

**TAVT Base = Higher of:**
1. **Purchase price** (amount paid by buyer)
2. **DMV assessed value** (state-determined fair market value)

**Why This Matters:**
Georgia uses the **higher** value to prevent tax avoidance through underreported sale prices.

**Example 1: Purchase Price Higher**
```
Purchase Price:                $32,000
DMV Assessed Value:            $30,000
TAVT Base:                     $32,000 (higher value)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,240
```

**Example 2: DMV Assessed Value Higher**
```
Purchase Price:                $28,000
DMV Assessed Value:            $30,000
TAVT Base:                     $30,000 (higher value)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,100
```

**DMV Assessed Value:**
- Based on NADA, Kelley Blue Book, or other industry-standard valuation guides
- Adjusted for vehicle age, condition, mileage
- Determined by Georgia Department of Revenue

### 1.4 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL** - Trade-in credit applies under TAVT

#### How It Works
1. Trade-in value is deducted from vehicle purchase price
2. TAVT calculated on **net difference** (purchase price minus trade-in)
3. If DMV assessed value is higher than net price, DMV value is used as base

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $35,000
Trade-In Value:               -$12,000
Net Purchase Price:            $23,000

DMV Assessed Value:            $33,000
TAVT Base:                     $23,000 (net is lower than DMV value, use net)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $1,610

(vs. $2,450 if no trade-in credit)
Trade-in tax savings:          $840
```

**Legal Basis:**
- Georgia Code § 48-5C-1 - TAVT provisions
- Trade-in allowance reduces taxable base

**Critical Note:**
The trade-in credit applies to the purchase price calculation, but if the DMV assessed value (after trade-in) is still higher, the DMV value becomes the TAVT base.

### 1.5 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** - Manufacturer rebates do NOT reduce TAVT base

#### Tax Treatment
Under TAVT, manufacturer rebates are taxable:
- TAVT is calculated on price **before** rebates are applied
- Buyer pays TAVT on full vehicle price before manufacturer incentives
- Rebates applied AFTER TAVT calculation

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $28,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Customer Pays:                 $25,000

TAVT Base:                     $28,000 (full MSRP before rebate)
                               OR DMV assessed value if higher
TAVT @ 7%:                     $1,960

Customer Final Payment:        $25,000 + $1,960 = $26,960
```

**Contrast with Trade-Ins:**
Unlike trade-ins (which DO reduce the TAVT base), manufacturer rebates provide no tax benefit to the buyer under Georgia's TAVT system.

### 1.6 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** Dealer rebates are TAXABLE (same as manufacturer rebates)

Dealer incentives and rebates follow the same treatment as manufacturer rebates:
- TAVT calculated on purchase price before dealer rebates
- Customer receives rebate after TAVT is paid
- No reduction to TAVT base

### 1.7 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability

**Policy:** Doc fees are **NOT subject to TAVT**

Documentation fees are NOT included in the TAVT base calculation. They are separate service charges.

**Note:** Doc fees may be subject to regular state sales tax (4%) separately from TAVT, but this is distinct from the vehicle TAVT calculation.

**Average Doc Fee:** ~$399 (Georgia average, no state-mandated cap)

### 1.8 Title and Registration Fees

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** - Government fees exempt

**Current Fees:**
- **Title Fee:** $18
- **Registration Fee:** Varies by vehicle value and type
- **License Plate Fee:** $20

Government fees are NOT subject to TAVT.

### 1.9 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** Service contracts are **NOT subject to TAVT**

Extended warranties and service contracts (VSC) sold with vehicles are NOT subject to the Title Ad Valorem Tax.

**Note:** Service contracts may be subject to regular state sales tax (4%) when purchased separately, but they are NOT included in the TAVT base for vehicle taxation.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Service Contract:              $2,500
TAVT Base:                     $30,000 (VSC NOT included)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,100

(Service contract may have separate 4% sales tax: $100)
```

### 1.10 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** GAP is **NOT subject to TAVT**

GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance is NOT subject to the Title Ad Valorem Tax.

**Note:** GAP may be subject to insurance premium tax or sales tax separately, but it is NOT included in the TAVT base.

### 1.11 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** Accessories included in vehicle sale are subject to TAVT

#### Accessories Purchased WITH Vehicle
**Included in TAVT base** if sold as part of the vehicle

- Dealer-installed accessories that are part of the vehicle sale price are included in TAVT calculation
- Includes: aftermarket wheels, running boards, lift kits, audio systems, etc.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Accessories (included):        +$2,000
Total Sale Price:              $30,000
TAVT Base:                     $30,000 (or DMV value if higher)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,100
```

### 1.12 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** Negative equity is **TAXABLE** under TAVT

#### Treatment
Negative equity rolled into the vehicle purchase increases the purchase price and thus the TAVT base.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $28,000
Trade-In Value:                $12,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$15,000
Negative Equity:               -$3,000

Effective Purchase Price:      $28,000 + $3,000 = $31,000
Less Trade-In Credit:          -$12,000
Net TAVT Base:                 $19,000

TAVT @ 7%:                     $1,330

Note: Negative equity increases purchase price, then trade-in credit applies.
```

## 2. LEASE TAXATION (DIFFERENT FROM RETAIL)

### 2.1 Lease Tax System - Not TAVT

**CRITICAL:** Leases do NOT use TAVT

Georgia leases are taxed using a completely different system from retail purchases:
- **Leases use regular 4% state sales tax** (NOT TAVT)
- Tax is applied to **monthly lease payments**
- **No local jurisdiction rates** on leases (state-only)
- TAVT does NOT apply to leased vehicles

**Why Different:**
TAVT is a tax on vehicle ownership/title transfer. Since leased vehicles remain titled to the leasing company, TAVT does not apply. Instead, leases are taxed as short-term rentals under standard sales tax law.

### 2.2 Lease Tax Rate

**Rate:** **4.0%** state sales tax on monthly payments

- **State Sales Tax:** 4.0%
- **Local/County Tax:** NONE (leases are state-only)
- **No TAVT on leases**

**Example:**
```
Monthly Lease Payment:         $450
Sales Tax @ 4%:                $18
Total Monthly Payment:         $468

Over 36 months:                $648 in total tax
```

### 2.3 Lease Taxation Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION**

Georgia taxes each monthly lease payment:
- 4% sales tax applied to each payment
- Tax is NOT paid upfront
- Tax accumulates over the lease term

**Example:**
```
Base Monthly Payment:          $500
Monthly Sales Tax (4%):        $20
Total Monthly:                 $520

36-month lease:
Total payments:                $18,000
Total tax:                     $720
```

### 2.4 Cap Cost Reduction on Leases

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions are **NOT taxed**

Down payments, cash, rebates, and trade-ins that reduce capitalized cost are NOT taxed upfront. They reduce the cap cost, which reduces monthly payments, which reduces the monthly sales tax.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $40,000
Cash Down:                     $5,000
Trade-In:                      $8,000
Total Cap Reduction:           $13,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $27,000

Monthly Payment (lower due to cap reduction): $380
Monthly Tax (4%):              $15.20

Cap reductions NOT taxed upfront, but they reduce monthly payment and thus monthly tax.
```

### 2.5 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **CAP_COST_ONLY** - Trade-in reduces cap cost

Trade-ins on leases reduce the capitalized cost, which lowers monthly payments and thus lowers monthly sales tax paid.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $25,000

Without trade-in monthly payment:  $500
With trade-in monthly payment:     $360

Tax without trade-in (4% × $500):  $20/month
Tax with trade-in (4% × $360):     $14.40/month
Monthly tax savings:                $5.60

Over 36 months, trade-in saves:     $201.60 in taxes
```

### 2.6 Rebates on Leases

**Policy:** Rebates applied to cap reduction are NOT taxed

Manufacturer and dealer rebates that reduce the capitalized cost are not taxed upfront. They lower the monthly payment and thus the monthly sales tax.

**Treatment:** Similar to cash down payments - reduces cap cost and monthly payments.

### 2.7 Backend Products on Leases

**Policy:** Service contracts and GAP NOT subject to sales tax when capitalized

#### Service Contracts (VSC)
**NOT taxed** when capitalized into lease

#### GAP Insurance
**NOT taxed** when capitalized into lease

**Example:**
```
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $28,000
Service Contract (capitalized): $2,000
GAP (capitalized):             $695
Total Capitalized:             $30,695

Monthly Payment (includes VSC/GAP): $445
Monthly Tax (4% on full payment):   $17.80

VSC and GAP are NOT separately taxed, but included in monthly payment base.
```

### 2.8 Documentation Fee on Leases

**Policy:** Doc fees are **TAXABLE** on leases at 4% rate

Doc fees on lease transactions are subject to the 4% state sales tax.

### 2.9 Negative Equity on Leases

**Policy:** Negative equity is **TAXABLE** via increased monthly payments

Negative equity rolled into a lease increases the capitalized cost, which increases monthly payments, which increases the monthly sales tax.

**Example:**
```
Base Cap Cost:                 $32,000
Negative Equity:               +$4,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $36,000

Higher monthly payment:        $510 (vs. $450 without negative equity)
Monthly tax (4% × $510):       $20.40
Additional tax per month:      $2.40

Over 36 months:                $86.40 additional tax due to negative equity
```

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** Georgia provides **LIMITED RECIPROCITY** with credit capped at GA TAVT/tax amount

"Georgia provides credit for sales tax or similar tax paid in another state, capped at the Georgia TAVT amount."
- Georgia Department of Revenue guidance

#### Legal Framework
Georgia Code Title 48, Chapter 5C provisions:
- Credit for sales/use tax paid to another state
- Credit applies when vehicle titled elsewhere is brought to Georgia
- Requires proof of tax paid (title, registration, receipt)
- Credit is capped at Georgia TAVT or sales tax amount

#### How It Works

**Scenario 1: Other State Tax > Georgia Tax**
If tax paid to another state exceeds Georgia's tax, NO additional Georgia tax is due.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in California:  $30,000
California tax paid (7.25%):      $2,175
Georgia TAVT (7%):                $2,100
Credit allowed:                   $2,100 (capped at GA amount)
Additional GA tax due:            $0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Tax < Georgia Tax**
If tax paid to another state is less than Georgia's tax, pay the DIFFERENCE.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Florida:     $30,000
Florida tax paid (6%):            $1,800
Georgia TAVT (7%):                $2,100
Credit allowed:                   $1,800 (FL tax paid)
Additional GA tax due:            $300 (difference)
```

**Scenario 3: No Tax Paid (e.g., Montana, Oregon)**
If no tax paid in another state, full Georgia TAVT is due.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana:     $30,000
Montana tax paid (0%):            $0
Georgia TAVT (7%):                $2,100
Credit allowed:                   $0
Additional GA tax due:            $2,100 (full amount)
```

### 3.2 Documentation Required

**Required Proof:**
- Prior state title showing tax paid
- Registration showing tax paid
- Receipt or invoice showing tax amount
- Documentation that tax was legally imposed (not voluntary)

### 3.3 Lease Reciprocity

**Policy:** Same reciprocity treatment for leases

Georgia provides the same limited reciprocity for lease transactions. Credit for prior state tax paid is capped at Georgia's lease tax amount.

---

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 TAVT System (Not Sales Tax)

**Feature:** Georgia uses TAVT instead of traditional sales tax for vehicles

**Why Unique:**
- **One-time tax** at title (not annual property tax)
- **Single state rate** (no local stacking)
- Based on **fair market value** (protects against underreporting)
- **Replaces annual ad valorem** (property tax on vehicles)

**Benefits to Consumers:**
- Simplified - one-time payment vs. annual property tax
- Predictable - fixed 7% rate statewide
- Fair - based on actual market value

**Comparison to Traditional Sales Tax:**
| Aspect | TAVT (Georgia) | Traditional Sales Tax |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| When paid | Once at title | Once at purchase |
| Annual tax after | None | Annual property tax in many states |
| Rate structure | Single state rate (7%) | State + local stacking |
| Base | Higher of price or FMV | Purchase price |

### 4.2 Different Systems for Retail vs. Lease

**Feature:** Retail uses TAVT, leases use sales tax

**Retail (TAVT):**
- 7% one-time tax at title
- Based on fair market value
- No local rates

**Lease (Sales Tax):**
- 4% monthly on payments
- NOT based on FMV
- Also no local rates

**Why Notable:** Most states use the same taxation method for both retail and lease. Georgia's dual system is unusual.

### 4.3 Higher of Purchase Price or DMV Assessed Value

**Feature:** TAVT base is the higher of two values

This prevents tax avoidance through underreported sale prices:
- Seller and buyer cannot collude to report artificially low price
- State ensures tax based on true market value
- Protects state revenue

**Example of Protection:**
```
Private party sale reported price: $15,000
DMV assessed value:                $25,000
TAVT Base:                         $25,000 (DMV value used)
TAVT @ 7%:                         $1,750

(vs. $1,050 if reported price used)
State protected from $700 revenue loss
```

### 4.4 No Local Jurisdiction Tax on Vehicles

**Feature:** TAVT and lease tax are state-only (no county/city rates)

**Contrast with Most States:**
- Most states: State rate + county + city = 6% to 11%+
- Georgia: Flat 7% TAVT or 4% lease tax statewide

**Benefits:**
- Simplicity - same rate everywhere in Georgia
- No "rate shopping" between jurisdictions
- Easier compliance for dealers

### 4.5 Rebates Are Taxable (TAVT Calculated Before Rebates)

**Feature:** Manufacturer/dealer rebates do NOT reduce TAVT base

**Impact:**
```
$30,000 vehicle with $5,000 manufacturer rebate:

Customer pays:                 $25,000
TAVT base:                     $30,000 (before rebate)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,100

Effective tax rate on what customer pays: 8.4% ($2,100 / $25,000)
```

**Why Notable:** Some states allow manufacturer rebates to reduce tax base. Georgia does not, which increases effective tax burden on rebate-heavy purchases.

---

## 5. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 Statewide Uniformity

**Georgia TAVT/lease tax is uniform statewide:**
- No county variations
- No city variations
- No special district taxes
- Same 7% TAVT or 4% lease tax everywhere

**Counties:**
All 159 Georgia counties use the same TAVT rate (7%) and lease tax rate (4%).

**Major Metro Areas:**
| Market | TAVT | Lease Tax | Notes |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Atlanta Metro** | 7% | 4% | Same as statewide |
| **Augusta** | 7% | 4% | Same as statewide |
| **Columbus** | 7% | 4% | Same as statewide |
| **Macon** | 7% | 4% | Same as statewide |
| **Savannah** | 7% | 4% | Same as statewide |
| **Athens** | 7% | 4% | Same as statewide |

### 5.2 No Rate Shopping

Unlike states with local tax variations, Georgia buyers cannot save money by purchasing in a lower-tax county. TAVT is the same everywhere.

---

## 6. HISTORICAL CHANGES AND TRENDS

### 6.1 TAVT Implementation (March 1, 2013)

**Major Reform:**
Prior to March 1, 2013, Georgia used:
- Traditional sales tax on vehicle purchases (state + local)
- Annual ad valorem (property tax) on owned vehicles

**TAVT Replaced Both:**
- One-time 6.5% TAVT at title (increased to 7% in 2018)
- Eliminated annual property tax on vehicles

**Benefits:**
- Simplified tax structure
- Eliminated annual recurring tax burden
- Made vehicle ownership more predictable

### 6.2 TAVT Rate Changes

**Rate History:**
- **March 1, 2013 - June 30, 2013:** 6.5%
- **July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2018:** 6.75%
- **July 1, 2018 - present:** 7.0%

### 6.3 Future Considerations

**Potential Changes to Watch:**
- TAVT rate adjustments (state legislature can modify)
- Assessed value methodology changes
- Electric vehicle taxation (special provisions may be added)

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TAX CALCULATION SYSTEM

### 8.1 Required Data Points

To correctly calculate Georgia TAVT/lease tax, the system must capture:

**Vehicle Transaction Data:**
- [ ] Vehicle sale/lease price
- [ ] DMV assessed value (for TAVT calculation)
- [ ] Trade-in value (if applicable)
- [ ] Trade-in payoff amount (if applicable)
- [ ] Negative equity from trade-in
- [ ] Manufacturer rebates (amount - TAXABLE for TAVT)
- [ ] Dealer rebates (amount - TAXABLE for TAVT)
- [ ] Accessories included in sale
- [ ] Documentation fee amount
- [ ] Service contract amount (NOT in TAVT base)
- [ ] GAP coverage amount (NOT in TAVT base)

**Transaction Type:**
- [ ] Purchase (TAVT applies) vs. Lease (sales tax applies)
- [ ] New vs. Used vehicle
- [ ] Out-of-state purchase (reciprocity check)

**For TAVT (Retail):**
- [ ] DMV assessed value lookup
- [ ] Use higher of purchase price or DMV value
- [ ] Prior state tax paid (if reciprocity applies)

**For Leases:**
- [ ] Capitalized cost
- [ ] Cap cost reductions (not taxed upfront)
- [ ] Monthly lease payment amount
- [ ] Lease term (months)

### 8.2 Calculation Logic

#### TAVT (RETAIL PURCHASE) CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Net Purchase Price (After Trade-In)
  Net_Purchase_Price = Vehicle_Price
                      + Accessories (if included)
                      + Negative_Equity
                      - Trade_In_Value

  (Do NOT subtract manufacturer/dealer rebates)

STEP 2: Determine DMV Assessed Value
  DMV_Assessed_Value = [Lookup from state valuation guide]

  Based on:
  - Vehicle year, make, model
  - Mileage
  - Condition
  - Options/trim

STEP 3: Determine TAVT Base
  TAVT_Base = MAX(Net_Purchase_Price, DMV_Assessed_Value)

  Use whichever is HIGHER

STEP 4: Calculate TAVT
  TAVT = TAVT_Base × 0.07  (7%)

STEP 5: Check Reciprocity (if out-of-state purchase)
  IF prior_state_tax_paid > 0:
    Credit = MIN(prior_state_tax_paid, TAVT)
    TAVT_Due = TAVT - Credit
  ELSE:
    TAVT_Due = TAVT

STEP 6: Calculate Total Amount Due
  Total_Due = Net_Purchase_Price + TAVT_Due + Title_Fees + Registration_Fees
```

**Example Implementation (TAVT):**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $32,000
Accessories:                   $2,000
Trade-In Value:                -$10,000
Net Purchase Price:            $24,000

DMV Assessed Value:            $30,000
TAVT Base:                     $30,000 (higher than net price)

TAVT @ 7%:                     $2,100
Title Fee:                     $18
Registration:                  $20

Total Due:                     $26,138
```

#### LEASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Adjusted Cap Cost
  Adjusted_Cap_Cost = Gross_Cap_Cost
                     - Cash_Down
                     - Trade_In_Value
                     - Manufacturer_Rebates
                     - Dealer_Rebates

  (All cap reductions are NOT taxed upfront)

STEP 2: Calculate Monthly Payment
  Monthly_Payment = [Lease calculation based on adjusted cap cost]

STEP 3: Calculate Monthly Sales Tax
  Monthly_Sales_Tax = Monthly_Payment × 0.04  (4%)

STEP 4: Calculate Total Monthly Payment
  Total_Monthly = Monthly_Payment + Monthly_Sales_Tax

STEP 5: Calculate Total Lease Tax Over Term
  Total_Lease_Tax = Monthly_Sales_Tax × Lease_Term_Months
```

**Example Implementation (Lease):**
```
LEASE TERMS:
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Cash Down:                     $5,000
Trade-In:                      $8,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           $2,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $20,000

Monthly Payment (base):        $320
Monthly Sales Tax (4%):        $12.80
Total Monthly Payment:         $332.80

36-month term:
Total lease tax:               $460.80
```

### 8.3 Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

#### Edge Case 1: DMV Assessed Value Higher Than Purchase Price
```
Purchase Price:                $22,000
Trade-In:                      -$8,000
Net:                           $14,000

DMV Assessed Value:            $25,000
TAVT Base:                     $25,000 (DMV higher)
TAVT @ 7%:                     $1,750
```

#### Edge Case 2: Manufacturer Rebate (Taxable)
```
MSRP:                          $28,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Customer Pays:                 $25,000

TAVT Base:                     $28,000 (before rebate) OR DMV value if higher
TAVT @ 7%:                     $1,960

Customer pays $25,000 + $1,960 = $26,960 total
Effective tax: 7.84% on what customer paid
```

#### Edge Case 3: Out-of-State Purchase with Reciprocity
```
Vehicle purchased in Florida:  $30,000
Florida tax paid (6%):         $1,800
Georgia TAVT (7%):             $2,100
Credit:                        $1,800 (FL tax paid)
Additional GA tax due:         $300

Total taxes paid:              $2,100 (Florida $1,800 + Georgia $300)
```

### 8.4 Validation Rules

**System should validate/flag:**

1. **TAVT Base Lower Than DMV Assessed Value**
   - Warning: Verify DMV assessed value is correctly looked up
   - Use higher value for TAVT calculation

2. **Manufacturer Rebate Reduces TAVT Base**
   - Error: Rebates do NOT reduce Georgia TAVT base
   - Recalculate with full price before rebates

3. **Service Contract or GAP in TAVT Base**
   - Error: VSC and GAP are NOT included in TAVT base
   - Remove from TAVT calculation

4. **Lease Using TAVT Calculation**
   - Error: Leases use 4% sales tax, NOT TAVT
   - Switch to lease tax calculation method

5. **Local Tax Added to TAVT or Lease Tax**
   - Error: Georgia TAVT and lease tax are state-only
   - Remove any local tax rates
