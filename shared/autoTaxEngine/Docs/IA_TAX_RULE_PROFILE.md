## Executive Summary

Iowa uses a **unique "Fee for New Registration" system** instead of traditional sales tax for vehicles. The state charges a **one-time registration fee of $10 plus 5% of the purchase/lease price**, with potential local option taxes up to 1% depending on the county. This is NOT technically a "sales tax" but rather a registration fee under Iowa Code Section 321.105A. Vehicles subject to registration are **EXEMPT from Iowa's 6% general sales tax**.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- Fee for New Registration: $10 + 5% of price (not traditional sales tax)
- Vehicles EXEMPT from Iowa's 6% general sales tax
- Local option tax up to 1% may apply by county
- Trade-in credit: FULL (100% deduction, no cap)
- Manufacturer and dealer rebates: Both reduce taxable price
- Doc fee: NOT taxable
- Service contracts and GAP: NOT taxable
- Lease taxation: FULL UPFRONT on total lease price
- Trade-ins on leases: ADDED to lease price (opposite of retail)
- Reciprocity: Credit for taxes paid elsewhere

## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX (FEE FOR NEW REGISTRATION)

### 1.1 Fee Structure (Current 2025)

#### State Fee
- **Base Rate:** 5.0% of purchase price
- **Flat Fee:** $10.00
- **Total Formula:** $10 + (purchase price × 5%)
- **Legal Basis:** Iowa Code Section 321.105A

#### Local Option Tax
- **Range:** 0% to 1.0% (varies by county)
- **Authority:** Counties may impose up to 1% additional tax
- **Application:** Applied to same base as state fee

#### Total Fee Range
- **Minimum:** $10 + 5% (counties without local option tax)
- **Maximum:** $10 + 6% (counties with 1% local option tax)
- **Most Common:** $10 + 5% to 5.5%

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:               -$10,000
Taxable Base:                  $20,000

State Fee (5%):                $1,000.00
Flat Fee:                      $10.00
Local Option (0.5%):           $100.00
Total Fee:                     $1,110.00
```

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This is a REGISTRATION FEE under Iowa Code 321.105A, not a sales tax under Iowa Code Chapter 423. Vehicles subject to registration are EXEMPT from Iowa's 6% general sales tax.

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL** - Trade-in value is fully deducted from purchase price

#### How It Works
1. Trade-in value is deducted from vehicle purchase price
2. Registration fee calculated on net difference
3. No cap or limit on trade-in amount
4. Applies to both state and local portions of fee

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $35,000
Trade-In Value:               -$15,000
Net Taxable Amount:            $20,000

Registration Fee:              $10 + ($20,000 × 5%) = $1,010
```

**Legal Basis:**
- Iowa Code Section 321.105A
- Iowa Department of Revenue guidance

**Requirement:** Trade-in must be a motor vehicle traded for another motor vehicle. Trading an off-road vehicle (ATV, snowmobile) for a motor vehicle does NOT qualify for trade-in credit.

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** - Manufacturer rebates reduce taxable purchase price

#### Tax Treatment
- Rebates are deducted BEFORE fee calculation
- Reduces the taxable base for registration fee
- Customer pays lower fee due to rebate

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $32,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Customer Price:                $29,000

Taxable Base:                  $29,000 (reduced by rebate)
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($29,000 × 5%) = $1,460
```

**Requirements:**
- Rebate must be monetary return from manufacturer
- Must be applied directly to vehicle's purchase price
- Must have fixed value at time of purchase

**Contrast with Other States:**
Unlike many states where manufacturer rebates are taxable (customer pays tax on full MSRP), Iowa allows rebates to reduce the taxable base, saving customers money on fees.

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** - Dealer rebates/incentives also reduce taxable price

Iowa does not distinguish between manufacturer and dealer rebates. Both types reduce the purchase price before the registration fee is calculated.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Dealer Incentive:              -$2,000
Customer Price:                $28,000

Taxable Base:                  $28,000
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($28,000 × 5%) = $1,410
```

### 1.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

#### Taxability
**NOT TAXABLE** - Documentation fees are excluded from the registration fee

Iowa Code explicitly excludes document fees from the taxable purchase price for registration fee purposes.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Doc Fee:                       $180
Total Customer Cost:           $28,180

Taxable Base (for fee):        $28,000 (doc fee excluded)
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($28,000 × 5%) = $1,410
```

#### Cap Amount
**CURRENTLY IN TRANSITION** - Previously $180, proposed elimination

- **Previous Cap:** $180 (Iowa Statute § 321.69)
- **2025 Legislation:** House File 758 (HF758) proposes to eliminate the cap
- **Status:** Check current Iowa law for most recent cap status
- **Transparency Requirements:** New legislation adds disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Dealers should verify the current doc fee cap with Iowa DOT or legal counsel, as this is actively changing.

### 1.6 Title Fee Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** when separately stated

Title fees are government fees and not subject to the registration fee.

**Current Title Fee:** Varies by county (typically $25-$50)

**Requirement:** Must be separately stated on purchase agreement

### 1.7 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** Service contracts are **NOT TAXABLE** if optional and separately itemized

#### Extended Warranty / Service Contract Sales
- Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC) are NOT subject to registration fee
- Must be optional (not mandatory)
- Must be separately itemized on purchase agreement
- Iowa Automobile Dealers Association (IADA) forms show "$0.00 sales tax" for VSC

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Service Contract:              $2,500
Total Purchase:                $32,500

Taxable Base (for fee):        $30,000 (VSC excluded)
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($30,000 × 5%) = $1,510
```

**Best Practice:** Clearly separate VSC on purchase agreement to avoid inclusion in taxable base.

### 1.8 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance is classified as an insurance product and is exempt from the registration fee.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
GAP Insurance:                 $895
Total Purchase:                $30,895

Taxable Base (for fee):        $30,000 (GAP excluded)
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($30,000 × 5%) = $1,510
```

### 1.9 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** if dealer-installed and included in cash price

#### Accessories Included WITH Vehicle
Dealer-installed accessories are included in the purchase price and subject to the 5% registration fee.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Dealer-Installed Accessories:  $2,000
Total Cash Price:              $30,000

Taxable Base (for fee):        $30,000
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($30,000 × 5%) = $1,510
```

**Per IADA Guidance:** "Accessories are included in the Cash Price and are taxed at the Iowa one-time registration fee rate of 5%."

### 1.10 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** Generally **TAXABLE** (added to purchase price)

#### For Vehicle PURCHASES (Sales)
Negative equity rolled into a new vehicle loan is generally included in the taxable base.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $28,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$14,000
Negative Equity:               -$4,000

Net Taxable Base:              $22,000 ($28,000 - $10,000 + $4,000)
Registration Fee:              $10 + ($22,000 × 5%) = $1,110
Amount Financed:               $22,110 (includes fee)
```

**Note:** Conservative interpretation includes negative equity in taxable base, though Iowa statutes do not explicitly address this scenario.

---

## 2. LEASE TAXATION (FULL UPFRONT ON TOTAL LEASE PRICE)

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **FULL UPFRONT** on total lease price

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:** Iowa does NOT tax leases on monthly payments like most states. Instead, Iowa calculates the TOTAL LEASE PRICE upfront and applies the 5% registration fee to that total amount, which is paid ONCE at lease inception.

**Legal Framework:**
Iowa Administrative Code Rule 701-31.5 - Motor Vehicle Use Tax on Long-term Leases

### 2.2 Lease Fee Calculation

#### Lease Price Formula
Per Iowa Admin. Code 701-31.5:

```
Lease Price = (Monthly Payment × Number of Months) + Down Payment + Trade-in Value
```

**CRITICAL:** Trade-ins are ADDED to lease price (not subtracted like retail).

**Rationale:** Trade-ins reduce the monthly payment amount. To calculate the true total lease price, the trade-in value must be added back.

#### Registration Fee Formula
```
Registration Fee = $10 + (Lease Price × 5%) + Local Option Tax
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Monthly Payment:               $400
Lease Term:                    36 months
Down Payment:                  $2,000
Trade-In Value:                $5,000

Lease Price Calculation:
  ($400 × 36) + $2,000 + $5,000 = $21,400

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($21,400 × 5%) = $10 + $1,070 = $1,080
```

### 2.3 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions are **FULLY INCLUDED** in taxable lease price

In Iowa, capitalized cost reductions (down payments, trade-ins) are INCLUDED in the taxable lease price calculation.

**What is Included:**
- Cash down payments
- Trade-in value (ADDED to lease price)
- Any other cap cost reductions

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Cash Down:                     $3,000
Trade-In Value:                $6,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $26,000
Residual Value:                $20,000
Monthly Payment:               $350
Term:                          36 months

Lease Price (for tax):
  ($350 × 36) + $3,000 + $6,000 = $21,600

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($21,600 × 5%) = $1,090
```

### 2.4 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **NONE (inverse)** - Trade-ins are ADDED to lease price

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:** Iowa treats trade-ins on leases OPPOSITE to retail.

On retail sales:
- Trade-in REDUCES taxable base
- Saves customer money on registration fee

On leases:
- Trade-in is ADDED to lease price
- Trade-in value is part of the total consideration calculation

**Per Iowa Admin. Code 701-31.5:**
"The value of the trade-in shall be added in the computation of the lease price."

**Why This Matters:**
1. Trade-in reduces the cap cost
2. Lower cap cost = lower monthly payment
3. To calculate true total lease price, must add back trade-in value

**Example Comparison:**
```
RETAIL SCENARIO:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Trade-In:                      $10,000
Taxable Base:                  $20,000
Fee:                           $10 + ($20,000 × 5%) = $1,010

LEASE SCENARIO:
Monthly Payment:               $400
Lease Term:                    36 months
Trade-In:                      $10,000 (ADDED)
Lease Price:                   ($400 × 36) + $10,000 = $24,400
Fee:                           $10 + ($24,400 × 5%) = $1,230
```

### 2.5 Rebate Treatment on Leases

**Policy:** **Follow retail rule** - Rebates reduce cap cost, excluded from lease price

Per Iowa Admin. Code 701-31.5, manufacturer rebates are explicitly excluded from the lease price calculation. This means rebates are used to reduce the cap cost before calculating monthly payments, and the rebate amount is not included in the taxable lease price.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $32,000
Residual Value:                $20,000
Monthly Payment:               $400
Term:                          36 months

Lease Price (for tax):
  ($400 × 36) = $14,400 (rebate NOT added back)

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($14,400 × 5%) = $730
```

### 2.6 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Policy:** Backend products follow same rules as sales

#### Service Contracts (VSC)
**NOT TAXABLE**

Per Iowa Admin. Code 701-31.5, lease price excludes "optional service or warranty contracts subject to tax under Iowa Code section 422.43(6)."

#### GAP Insurance
**NOT TAXABLE**

GAP insurance is excluded from lease price (insurance exempt).

#### Doc Fee on Leases
**NOT TAXABLE**

Documentation fees are NOT subject to the registration fee on leases, consistent with retail treatment.

### 2.7 Negative Equity on Leases

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

If negative equity is rolled into the lease (increasing cap cost), it increases the monthly payment, which increases the taxable lease price.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Trade-In Value:                $8,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$12,000
Negative Equity:               -$4,000
Effective Cap Cost:            $43,000
Residual Value:                $25,000
Monthly Payment:               $550
Term:                          36 months

Lease Price (for tax):
  ($550 × 36) + $8,000 = $27,800

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($27,800 × 5%) = $1,400
```

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** Iowa provides **RECIPROCAL CREDIT** for taxes paid to other states

Iowa allows credit for sales tax or similar registration fees paid to another state when registering a vehicle in Iowa.

#### Legal Framework
- Credit is capped at the Iowa registration fee amount
- Requires proof of tax paid (title, registration, receipt)
- Applies when a vehicle titled elsewhere is brought to Iowa

#### How Credits Work

**Scenario 1: Other State Tax ≥ Iowa Fee**
If tax paid to another state equals or exceeds Iowa's fee, NO additional Iowa fee is due.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Minnesota: $30,000
Minnesota tax paid (6.875%):    $2,062.50
Iowa fee would be (5% + $10):   $1,510
Credit allowed:                 $1,510
Additional IA fee due:          $0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Tax < Iowa Fee**
If tax paid to another state is less than Iowa's fee, pay the DIFFERENCE.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in North Carolina: $30,000
North Carolina tax paid (3%):        $900
Iowa fee would be (5% + $10):        $1,510
Credit allowed:                      $900
Additional IA fee due:               $610
```

**Scenario 3: No Tax Paid (Montana, etc.)**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana:   $30,000
Montana tax paid (0%):          $0
Iowa fee due (5% + $10):        $1,510
Credit allowed:                 $0
Additional IA fee due:          $1,510
```

### 3.2 Documentation Required

To receive reciprocity credit:
- Proof of sales tax payment to other state
- Bill of sale or purchase agreement
- Tax receipt from other state DMV/DOR
- Prior title showing tax paid

## 4. UNIQUE IOWA FEATURES

### 4.1 Fee for New Registration System

**Feature:** Iowa uses "Fee for New Registration" instead of traditional sales tax

**Key Differences:**
1. **Not a Sales Tax:** Codified under Iowa Code 321.105A (Motor Vehicle Registration), NOT Iowa Code Chapter 423 (Sales Tax)
2. **Vehicles Are Exempt:** Vehicles subject to registration are EXEMPT from Iowa's 6% general sales tax
3. **Registration-Based:** Fee is collected by county treasurer at time of registration
4. **Fund Allocation:** Funds go to Road Use Tax Fund and counties

**Example:**
```
General merchandise sale:       Subject to 6% sales tax
Motor vehicle sale:             EXEMPT from 6% sales tax
                               Subject to 5% registration fee + $10
```

### 4.2 Lease Taxation Method (Total Lease Price)

**Feature:** Iowa calculates tax on TOTAL LEASE PRICE upfront, not monthly

**How It Differs from Other States:**
- Most states: Tax each monthly payment as paid
- Iowa: Calculate total lease price upfront, tax once

**Formula:** Lease Price = (Monthly Payment × Months) + Down Payment + Trade-in Value

**Example:**
```
California (Monthly):
  $400/month × 7.25% = $29/month tax
  Total tax over 36 months: $1,044

Iowa (Upfront):
  Lease price: ($400 × 36) + $2,000 down + $5,000 trade = $21,400
  Tax: $10 + ($21,400 × 5%) = $1,080 (paid once)
```

### 4.3 Trade-In Treatment Differences (Retail vs. Lease)

**Feature:** Trade-ins have OPPOSITE effects on retail vs. lease taxation

| Transaction Type | Trade-In Treatment | Tax Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Retail Purchase** | Reduces taxable amount | Saves buyer money on fee |
| **Lease** | ADDED to lease price | Increases taxable lease price |

**Example Impact:**
```
$10,000 Trade-In Value

RETAIL PURCHASE:
  Reduces fee by: $10,000 × 5% = $500 savings

LEASE:
  Adds to lease price: $10,000
  Increases fee by: $10,000 × 5% = $500
```

### 4.4 Rebate Treatment (Both Types Non-Taxable)

**Feature:** Both manufacturer AND dealer rebates reduce taxable base

Unlike states like Colorado (where manufacturer rebates are taxable) or Michigan (where rebates are taxable on some transactions), Iowa treats ALL rebates as non-taxable deductions from purchase price.

### 4.5 Doc Fee Non-Taxability

**Feature:** Doc fees explicitly excluded from registration fee

While many states tax doc fees at the same rate as vehicles, Iowa explicitly excludes them, saving customers money.

**Example:**
```
$180 Doc Fee

States that tax doc fee:
  Tax on doc fee: $180 × 5% = $9

Iowa:
  Tax on doc fee: $0
```

### 4.6 Local Option Tax Variation

**Feature:** Counties may impose up to 1% additional registration fee

**Application:** Not all counties use this authority, creating variation across Iowa

**Range:**
- Minimum: 5% (counties without local option)
- Maximum: 6% (counties with 1% local option)

**Check Local Rates:** Contact Iowa DOT or county treasurer for specific county rates

---

## 5. COUNTY AND REGIONAL DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 Local Option Tax Authority

Iowa counties have authority to impose local option sales taxes up to 1% on vehicle registrations.

**Note:** This is less common than in other states. Many Iowa counties do NOT impose additional local option tax on vehicles.

### 5.2 Fee Collection Point

**Rule:** Fee collected by county treasurer at time of registration

**Application:** The county where the vehicle is registered collects the fee, which includes both state and local components.

### 7.2 Calculation Logic

#### RETAIL PURCHASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Taxable Base
  Vehicle_Price
  + Accessories
  - Trade_In_Value
  - Manufacturer_Rebates
  - Dealer_Rebates
  = Taxable_Base

STEP 2: Calculate State Registration Fee
  State_Fee = Taxable_Base × 0.05 (5%)

STEP 3: Calculate Local Option Tax (if applicable)
  Local_Tax = Taxable_Base × Local_Rate (0% to 1%)

STEP 4: Add Flat Fee
  Flat_Fee = $10.00

STEP 5: Calculate Total Registration Fee
  Total_Fee = Flat_Fee + State_Fee + Local_Tax

STEP 6: Exclude Non-Taxable Items
  Doc_Fee_Tax = $0
  Title_Fee_Tax = $0
  VSC_Tax = $0
  GAP_Tax = $0

STEP 7: Calculate Total Amount Due
  Total_Due = Taxable_Base + Total_Fee + Doc_Fee + Title_Fee + VSC + GAP
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000.00
Accessories:                   $1,500.00

Doc Fee:                       $180.00 (NOT taxed)
Title Fee:                     $25.00 (NOT taxed)
Service Contract:              $2,500.00 (NOT taxed)
GAP:                           $895.00 (NOT taxed)

Total Amount Due:              $24,182.50
```

#### LEASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Total Lease Price
  Lease_Price = (Monthly_Payment × Lease_Term_Months)
                + Down_Payment
                + Trade_In_Value  (ADDED, not subtracted)

  EXCLUDE from lease price:
  - Manufacturer rebates (used to reduce cap cost, not added back)
  - Service contracts
  - GAP insurance
  - Doc fee

STEP 2: Calculate State Registration Fee
  State_Fee = Lease_Price × 0.05 (5%)

STEP 3: Calculate Local Option Tax
  Local_Tax = Lease_Price × Local_Rate

STEP 4: Add Flat Fee
  Flat_Fee = $10.00

STEP 5: Calculate Total Registration Fee
  Total_Fee = Flat_Fee + State_Fee + Local_Tax
  (Paid upfront at lease inception)

STEP 6: Add Non-Taxable Items
  Service contracts, GAP, doc fee, title fee
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
LEASE TERMS:
Monthly Payment:               $400.00
Lease Term:                    36 months
Down Payment:                  $2,000.00
Trade-In Value:                $5,000.00
Manufacturer Rebate:           (already applied to cap cost, excluded)
Service Contract:              $1,800.00
GAP Insurance:                 $695.00
Doc Fee:                       $180.00

Lease Price Calculation:
  ($400 × 36) + $2,000 + $5,000 = $21,400

State Fee (5%):                $1,070.00
Flat Fee:                      $10.00
Local Option (0%):             $0.00
Total Registration Fee:        $1,080.00 (due at signing)

Due at Signing:
  Down Payment:                $2,000.00
  Registration Fee:            $1,080.00
  Doc Fee:                     $180.00
  Service Contract:            $1,800.00
  GAP:                         $695.00
  Title Fee:                   $25.00
  Total Due:                   $5,780.00
```

### 7.3 Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

#### Edge Case 1: Negative Equity on Purchase
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$14,000
Negative Equity:               -$4,000

Taxable Base:
  $28,000 - $10,000 + $4,000 = $22,000

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($22,000 × 5%) = $1,110

Amount Financed:
  $22,000 + $1,110 = $23,110
```

#### Edge Case 2: Large Manufacturer Rebate
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $40,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$8,000
Customer Pays:                 $32,000

Taxable Base:                  $32,000 (rebate reduces base)

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($32,000 × 5%) = $1,610

Savings vs. taxing full MSRP:
  $40,000 × 5% = $2,000
  $32,000 × 5% = $1,600
  Savings: $400
```

#### Edge Case 3: Lease with Negative Equity
```
Monthly Payment:               $550
Lease Term:                    36 months
Trade-In Value:                $8,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$12,000
Negative Equity:               -$4,000

Lease Price:
  ($550 × 36) + $8,000 = $27,800

Registration Fee:
  $10 + ($27,800 × 5%) = $1,400
```

### 7.4 Validation Rules

**System should validate/flag:**

1. **Trade-In Value > Purchase Price**
   - Flag for review (possible data entry error)

2. **Doc Fee > $200**
   - Warning: Iowa doc fee cap discussion (verify current law)

3. **Title Fee ≠ Expected County Amount**
   - Verify current county title fee

4. **Lease Trade-In Treatment**
   - Ensure trade-in is ADDED to lease price (not subtracted)

5. **Rebates Applied to Lease Price**
   - Ensure manufacturer rebates are NOT added back to lease price

6. **Service Contracts or GAP Taxed**
   - Error: These products should NOT be taxed

7. **Doc Fee Taxed**
   - Error: Doc fee should NOT be included in taxable base

8. **Local Option Tax > 1%**
   - Error: Maximum local option tax is 1%

### 7.5 Error Messages and User Guidance

**Suggested Error Messages:**

```
ERROR: Trade-in added to lease price incorrectly
→ "Iowa lease price calculation: Trade-in value of $X should be ADDED to
   lease price, not subtracted. Lease price = (payment × months) + down + trade-in."

ERROR: Doc fee included in taxable base
→ "Documentation fees are NOT subject to Iowa registration fee. Remove $X
   from taxable base."

ERROR: Service contract taxed
→ "Service contracts are NOT subject to Iowa registration fee if optional
   and separately itemized. Remove tax from VSC."

WARNING: Negative equity on lease
→ "Negative equity of $X rolled into lease increases monthly payment and
   taxable lease price."

INFO: Rebate treatment
→ "Manufacturer rebate of $X reduces taxable base. Fee calculated on $Y
   after rebate deduction."
```
