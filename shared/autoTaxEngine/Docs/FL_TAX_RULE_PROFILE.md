### Tax Credit for Out-of-State Taxes Paid
- **Credit Allowed:** Yes - Florida provides credit for sales tax paid to another state
- **Formula:**
  ```
  Florida Use Tax Due = FL Tax - Tax Paid to Other State
  If (Tax Paid to Other State >= FL Tax), then No Additional Tax Due
  ```

## 6. TRADE-IN CREDIT POLICIES

### Trade-In Credit Limits

| Year | Maximum Trade-In Credit |
|------|------------------------|
| 2024 | Lesser of $10,000 or trade-in value |
| 2025 | Lesser of $11,000 or trade-in value |

### Trade-In Credit Rules
- **Application:** Trade-in value reduces taxable purchase price BEFORE calculating sales tax
- **Dealer Sales Only:** Trade-in credit applies only to dealer transactions, NOT private party sales
- **Same Transaction Requirement:** Trade-in and purchase must occur at same dealership in same transaction

### Trade-In Calculation Formula

```
Taxable Amount = Purchase Price - MIN(Trade-In Value, Maximum Credit)
Sales Tax = (Taxable Amount × 6%) + (MIN(Taxable Amount, $5,000) × Surtax Rate)
```

### Trade-In Examples

**Example 1 (2025): $30,000 purchase, $8,000 trade-in, 1.5% Alachua County**
```
Taxable amount: $30,000 - $8,000 = $22,000
State tax: $22,000 × 6% = $1,320
Surtax: $5,000 × 1.5% = $75
Total tax: $1,395
```

**Example 2 (2025): $40,000 purchase, $15,000 trade-in, 1.0% Broward County**
```
Trade-in credit limited to: $11,000
Taxable amount: $40,000 - $11,000 = $29,000
State tax: $29,000 × 6% = $1,740
Surtax: $5,000 × 1.0% = $50
Total tax: $1,790
```

---

## 7. LEASE TAXATION RULES

### Lease Sales Tax Application
- **State Rate:** 6%
- **County Surtax:** Applied based on lessee's county of residence
- **Tax Applied To:** Monthly lease payment (not total lease amount or capitalized cost)
- **Surtax Cap:** $5,000 cap applies to EACH monthly payment

### Lease Tax Calculation Formula

```
Monthly Tax = (Monthly Payment × 6%) + (MIN(Monthly Payment, $5,000) × County Surtax Rate)
```

### Capitalized Cost Reduction (Down Payment)
- **Tax Treatment:** Sales tax typically charged on down payment at lease signing
- **Rate:** Same as monthly payment rate (6% + surtax)

### Documentary Stamp Tax on Leases
- **Rate:** $0.60 per $100 of total lease payments
- **Application:** Calculated on sum of all lease payments due during lease term
- **Formula:**
  ```
  Doc Stamp Tax = (Total of All Lease Payments ÷ 100) × $0.60
  ```

### Commercial Lease Exemption (Effective July 1, 2024)
- **Exemption:** Sales/use tax exclusion for certain motor vehicle leases
- **Qualifications:**
  - Lease period is 12+ months
  - Vehicle used in trade/business of lessee
  - Lessor has paid sales/use tax on vehicle purchase price

### Lease Examples

**Example 1: $500 monthly, 36 months, $2,000 down, 1.0% surtax**
```
Monthly tax: ($500 × 6%) + ($500 × 1.0%) = $35.00
Down payment tax: ($2,000 × 6%) + ($2,000 × 1.0%) = $140.00
Doc stamp: (($500 × 36) ÷ 100) × $0.60 = $108.00
Total tax over lease: ($35 × 36) + $140 + $108 = $1,508
```
