## Executive Summary

Vermont has a **FLAT 6.0% state sales tax** with **NO local taxes**, making it simple and uniform statewide. Vermont has TWO UNIQUE features that significantly impact buyers: **(1) NO trade-in credit on retail purchases** (tax on full vehicle price regardless of trade-in), and **(2) Service contracts (VSC) ARE TAXABLE**. Vermont uses **monthly lease taxation**, and interestingly, trade-ins DO provide benefit on leases (unlike retail purchases).

**CRITICAL BUYER IMPACT:** Vermont buyers pay significantly more sales tax on vehicles with trade-ins compared to states that allow trade-in credit. On a $30,000 vehicle with $10,000 trade-in, that's $600 MORE in sales tax.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- NO trade-in credit on retail purchases (UNIQUE - tax on full price)
- Service contracts (VSC) ARE TAXABLE at 6% (UNIQUE - most states exempt)
- Flat 6% statewide rate, NO local taxes (simple)
- Trade-ins DO reduce cap cost on leases (unlike retail)
- Separate annual Purchase and Use Tax (6% of MSRP year 1)
- $4,000 state EV incentive (not taxable when applied)
- LIMITED reciprocity (credit only if other state rate ≥ 6%)

## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 Tax Rates (Current 2025)

#### State Rate
- **State Sales Tax:** 6.0% (32 VSA § 9741)
- Applies uniformly across entire state

#### Local Rates
**NONE** - Vermont does not allow local sales taxes

**Combined Rate:** 6.0% statewide (no variation by location)

**Same rate whether purchasing in:**
- Burlington
- Montpelier (capital)
- Rural areas
- Any location in Vermont

**Tax Collection Point:** Based on dealer location (but rate is same everywhere)

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **NONE** - NO TRADE-IN CREDIT (CRITICAL UNIQUE FEATURE)

Vermont does NOT allow trade-in credit on retail purchases. This is a MAJOR difference from most other states.

**Official Guidance (VT Department of Taxes):**
"The sales tax is calculated on the full purchase price of the vehicle. Trade-in allowances do not reduce the taxable amount."

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:  $30,000
Trade-In Value:          $10,000
Customer Net Pays:       $20,000
TAXABLE BASE:            $30,000 (NOT $20,000)
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $1,800

Compare to states WITH trade-in credit:
Taxable Base:            $20,000
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $1,200
───────────────────────────────
Vermont Buyer Pays:      $600 MORE in sales tax
```

**Impact on Buyers:**
Vermont buyers pay significantly more sales tax than buyers in states that allow trade-in credit. For a $10,000 trade-in, that's $600 extra tax.

**Legislative History:**
Vermont has maintained this policy for decades to maximize sales tax revenue. Multiple attempts to change this have failed in the legislature.

**Source:** 32 VSA § 9741, VT Department of Taxes Sales Tax Guide

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** - Manufacturer rebates reduce sale price

Manufacturer rebates ARE deducted before sales tax calculation.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:            $25,000
Manufacturer Rebate:     -$2,000
───────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:            $23,000
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $1,380
```

**Vermont EV Incentive:**
Vermont offers $4,000 state incentive for new EV purchases. NOT taxable when applied at point of sale. Reduces taxable base like manufacturer rebate.

### 1.4 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

#### Taxability
**TAXABLE** - Documentation fees are subject to sales tax

#### Cap Amount
**NO CAP** - Vermont does not impose statutory limits on doc fees

- **Average Doc Fee:** $300-400
- **Observed Range:** $200 to $500
- Higher than low-tax states, lower than high-cost states

### 1.5 Service Contract (VSC) and GAP Taxability

**Service Contracts (VSC):** **TAXABLE** (UNIQUE VERMONT FEATURE)

Vermont is one of the few states that taxes extended warranties and service contracts at 6% sales tax rate.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:           $25,000
Service Contract (VSC):  $2,000
───────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:            $27,000
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $1,620
```

**GAP Insurance:** **NOT TAXABLE**
Treated as insurance product, exempt from sales tax.

### 1.6 Product Taxability Summary

| Item | Taxable? | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Vehicle Price | ✅ Yes | FULL price (no trade-in credit) |
| Trade-In | ✅ YES | NO CREDIT (unique VT rule) |
| Manufacturer Rebates | ❌ No | Reduce sale price before tax |
| Dealer Discounts | ❌ No | Reduce sale price |
| Doc Fee | ✅ Yes | Taxable, no cap (avg $300-400) |

| Title Fee | ❌ No | Government fee ($35) |
| Registration Fee | ❌ No | Government fee |

---

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION** (pure monthly method)

Vermont taxes leases on each monthly payment at 6% state rate.

**Tax Rate:** 6.0% (same as retail)

### 2.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions are **NOT TAXED** separately

Down payments, rebates, and trade-ins reduce the capitalized cost, which lowers monthly payments, which reduces total tax paid over the lease term.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:          $35,000
Trade-In:                -$8,000
Cash Down:               -$5,000
───────────────────────────────
Net Cap Cost:            $22,000
Monthly Payment:         $350
Monthly Tax @ 6.0%:      $21.00
Total Tax (36 months):   $756.00
```

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT** (DIFFERENT FROM RETAIL)

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:**
- **Retail purchases:** NO trade-in credit (Vermont unique rule)
- **Leases:** Trade-in DOES reduce cap cost (standard lease treatment)

On leases, trade-ins reduce the capitalized cost, which lowers monthly payments, reducing total tax over lease term.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:          $35,000
Trade-In:                -$8,000
───────────────────────────────
Net Cap Cost:            $27,000
Monthly Payment:         $400 (based on $27,000)
Monthly Tax @ 6%:        $24/month

Without Trade-In:
Monthly Payment:         $520 (based on $35,000)
Monthly Tax @ 6%:        $31.20/month
───────────────────────────────
Tax Savings from Trade-In: $7.20/month × 36 = $259.20
```

**This is a significant advantage for leasing vs. purchasing in Vermont.**

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Service Contracts (VSC):** TAXABLE (if capitalized, taxed monthly)
**GAP Insurance:** NOT taxable
**Doc Fee:** TAXABLE (if capitalized, taxed monthly; if upfront, taxed immediately)

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** Vermont provides **LIMITED RECIPROCAL CREDIT**

Credit ONLY allowed if other state's tax rate is **6% or higher**. If other state's rate is below 6%, NO credit allowed and FULL Vermont tax is due.

**Official Guidance (VT Department of Taxes):**
"Credit is allowed for sales or use tax paid to another state if that state's rate is equal to or greater than Vermont's 6% rate. If the other state's rate is lower, no credit is allowed and full Vermont tax is due."

**Example 1:** Other State Higher Rate
```
Vehicle purchased in California:    $30,000
California tax paid (7.5%):         $2,250
Vermont tax would be (6%):          $1,800
Credit allowed:                     $1,800 (full VT tax covered)
Additional VT tax due:              $0
```

**Example 2:** Other State Lower Rate (NO CREDIT)
```
Vehicle purchased in Delaware:      $30,000
Delaware tax paid (0%):             $0
Vermont tax due (6%):               $1,800
Credit allowed:                     $0 (DE rate < VT rate)
Additional VT tax due:              $1,800 (FULL amount)
```

**Example 3:** Other State at 5% (NO CREDIT)
```
Vehicle purchased in state with 5%: $30,000
Other state tax paid (5%):          $1,500
Vermont tax due (6%):               $1,800
Credit allowed:                     $0 (5% < 6%, no credit)
Additional VT tax due:              $1,800 (FULL amount)
```

**Credit Policy:**
"All or nothing" approach - either full credit (if ≥ 6%) or no credit (if < 6%). Unlike many states that provide partial credit, Vermont requires the other state's rate to meet or exceed 6% for any credit.

**Documentation Required:**
- Bill of sale showing purchase price
- Receipt showing taxes paid to other state
- Proof that other state's rate is ≥ 6%

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 NO Trade-In Credit on Retail Purchases

This is Vermont's MOST IMPACTFUL unique feature for vehicle buyers.

**Policy:** Tax calculated on FULL vehicle price, regardless of trade-in value

**Comparison to Other States:**
```
Example: $30,000 vehicle, $10,000 trade-in

States WITH trade-in credit:
Taxable Base:            $20,000
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $1,200

VERMONT (NO trade-in credit):
Taxable Base:            $30,000
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $1,800
───────────────────────────────
Vermont Buyer Pays:      $600 MORE
```

**Why Vermont Does This:**
Maximize sales tax revenue. Vermont has maintained this policy for decades despite multiple attempts to change it.

**Buyer Strategy:**
Vermont buyers with high-value trade-ins may benefit from:
1. Selling trade-in privately (to avoid paying tax on its value)
2. Leasing instead of purchasing (trade-ins reduce cap cost on leases)

### 4.2 Service Contracts (VSC) ARE TAXABLE

Vermont taxes extended warranties and service contracts at 6% sales tax rate. This is UNUSUAL - most states exempt services.

**Impact:**
```
Service Contract:        $2,000
Vermont Tax @ 6%:        $120

Most Other States:
Service Contract:        $2,000
Tax:                     $0 (exempt)
```

### 4.3 Flat 6% Statewide Rate (No Local Taxes)

**Simplicity:** Same rate everywhere in Vermont
- No need to look up local rates
- No variation by jurisdiction
- Easy to calculate

**Contrast to Complex States:**
- California: 7.25% - 10.5% (varies by location)
- Illinois: 6.25% - 11% (varies by location)
- Vermont: 6.0% (same everywhere)

### 4.4 Purchase and Use Tax (Separate Annual Tax)

**IMPORTANT:** Vermont has a SEPARATE annual Purchase and Use Tax on vehicles, distinct from the one-time sales tax.

**Annual Tax Based on Vehicle Value:**
- **Year 1:** 6% of MSRP
- **Subsequent years:** Based on NADA value
- Paid at annual registration
- Completely separate from sales tax

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle MSRP:        $30,000
Year 1 Purchase & Use Tax: $1,800 (6% of MSRP)
Year 2 (NADA $25,000):   $1,500 (6% of value)
Year 3 (NADA $21,000):   $1,260 (6% of value)
```

**Source:** 32 VSA § 8902

### 4.5 Vermont EV Incentive

**Amount:** $4,000 state incentive for new EV purchases

**Tax Treatment:** NOT taxable when applied at point of sale
- Reduces taxable base like manufacturer rebate
- Applied before calculating sales tax

**Example:**
```
EV MSRP:                 $40,000
VT EV Incentive:         -$4,000
───────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:            $36,000
Sales Tax @ 6%:          $2,160
```
