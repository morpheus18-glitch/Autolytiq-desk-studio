### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT** (no cap)

**How It Works:**
- Tax is calculated on the **net purchase price** (vehicle price minus trade-in value)
- Trade-in value is **completely exempt** from sales tax
- If trade-in value exceeds vehicle purchase price, **no tax is due**

**Formula:**
```
Taxable Amount = Vehicle Purchase Price - Trade-In Allowance - Manufacturer Rebates
Sales Tax = Taxable Amount × Applicable Tax Rate
```

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:       $10,000
Manufacturer Rebate:  $2,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:       $18,000
Sales Tax (4.225%):   $760.50
```

**Out-of-State Purchase Trade-Ins:**
- Must provide **proof of trade-in** to receive credit when titling in Missouri
- Acceptable proof:
  - Copy of front and back of title assigned to dealer
  - Copy of Secure Power of Attorney for trade-in vehicle

**Agricultural Exception:**
- Grain or livestock produced by purchaser may be traded for agricultural vehicles from licensed dealers

**Source:** 12 CSR 10-103.350(2)(A), RSMo 144.070

---

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Treatment:** **NON-TAXABLE** (reduces tax base)

**How It Works:**
- Manufacturer rebates are **deducted from the purchase price** before calculating sales tax
- Tax is calculated on the **net amount after rebate**
- Customer does not pay sales tax on the rebate amount

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:          $25,000
Manufacturer Rebate:   $3,000
Purchase Price:        $22,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:        $22,000
Sales Tax (4.225%):    $929.50
```

**Combined Example (Rebate + Trade-In):**
```
Vehicle Price:         $18,000
Dealer Rebate:         $500
Trade-In Allowance:    $3,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:        $14,500
($18,000 - $500 - $3,000)
```

**Source:** 12 CSR 10-103.350(1)

---

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate/Incentive Treatment

**Treatment:** **NON-TAXABLE** (same as manufacturer rebates)

Missouri does not distinguish between manufacturer rebates and dealer incentives for tax purposes. Both reduce the taxable purchase price.

**Source:** 12 CSR 10-103.350(1)

---

### 1.5 Documentary Fee Taxability and Cap

**Cap Amount:** **$604.47** (2025 licensure year)

**Annual Adjustment:**
- Increased annually based on Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
- 2024 Cap: $587.43
- 2025 Cap: $604.47 (2.9% increase)
- Published in Missouri Register by January 15 each year

**Taxability:** **TAXABLE** (subject to sales tax)

The documentary/administrative fee is included in the taxable purchase price and is subject to Missouri sales tax.

**Statutory Requirements:**

**What Dealers MAY Charge For:**
- Document storage services
- Administrative or clerical services

**What Dealers MAY NOT Charge For:**
- Filling in blanks on standardized forms
- Drafting, preparation, or completion of documents
- Providing legal advice

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- Must be itemized separately on retail buyer's order form

  > "AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE IS NOT AN OFFICIAL FEE AND IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW BUT MAY BE CHARGED BY A DEALER. A PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE MAY RESULT IN PROFIT TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER."

**Uniform Pricing:**
- Must charge same fee to all retail customers
- Exception: Franchise agreements may limit fees to certain customer classes

**Revenue Share:**
- 10% of fee remitted to Motor Vehicle Administration Technology Fund
- Reduced to 3.5% after FUSION system fully operational
- Expires January 1, 2037

**Source:** RSMo 301.558, 12 CSR 10-26.231

---

### 1.6 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE** (if separately stated)

**Requirements for Tax Exemption:**
1. Service contract price must be **separately stated** on invoice
2. Must be **optional** (not bundled into vehicle price)
3. Customer must have choice to decline

**HOWEVER:**
- **Replacement parts** used under service contracts **ARE TAXABLE**
- If dealer bills additional charges for repair parts, sales tax applies to those parts

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase:        $30,000 (taxable)
VSC (separately stated): $2,000  (NOT taxable)
───────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:          $30,000
Sales Tax (4.225%):      $1,267.50

Later repair under VSC:
Replacement Parts:       $500    (taxable when purchased)
```

**If NOT Separately Stated:**
- Service contract cost becomes part of total taxable purchase price

**Source:** 12 CSR 10-103.600, Missouri Sales Tax Handbook, Missouri Vehicle Sales Tax & Title Fees Guide (Suntrup)

---

### 1.7 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE** (insurance products are exempt)

**Rationale:**
- GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) is considered an **insurance product**
- Insurance policies are generally **exempt from Missouri sales tax**
- Classified as intangible service rather than tangible personal property

**Note on Total Loss Claims:**
- Missouri requires insurers to reimburse sales tax, title, and registration costs for replacement vehicles
- Buyer must complete and file **Sales Tax Credit Affidavit** with Missouri DOR
- Affidavit typically provided by insurance company
- Must be presented when replacement vehicle is titled and licensed

**Source:** Missouri sales tax exemptions framework, GAP Claims & Sales Tax guidance

---

### 1.8 Accessories Taxability

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE** (with limited exemptions)

**General Rule:**
All sales of tangible personal property, including vehicle accessories and aftermarket parts, are subject to Missouri sales tax at 4.225% plus applicable local taxes.

**Exemptions:**

1. **Motor Vehicle Dealers:**
   - Parts purchased for repair of vehicles being resold are exempt

2. **Common Carriers:**
   - Materials, replacement parts, and equipment for repair/maintenance of vehicles used as common carriers of persons or property are exempt

3. **Large Commercial Vehicles:**
   - Vehicles registered over 54,000 pounds used for hauling property on public highways
   - Materials, parts, and equipment for repair/maintenance are exempt

4. **Resale:**
   - Parts purchased by businesses for resale to customers are not taxable at wholesale level

**Typical Dealer Scenario:**
```
Vehicle Price:           $30,000
Dealer-Installed Accessories:
  - Floor Mats:          $200
  - Window Tint:         $400
  - Running Boards:      $800
─────────────────────────────
Total Purchase Price:    $31,400
Sales Tax (4.225%):      $1,326.65
```

**Source:** Missouri Sales Tax Exemptions (DOR), FAQs - Sales Tax Taxability and Exemptions

---

### 1.9 Negative Equity Taxability

**Treatment:** **NOT TAXABLE**

**How It Works:**
- Negative equity (amount owed beyond trade-in value) is **NOT added to taxable amount**
- Tax is calculated only on the **net purchase price** (new vehicle price minus trade-in value)
- Negative equity is rolled into loan balance but does not increase tax liability

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:       $30,000
Trade-In Value:          $5,000
Amount Still Owed:       $8,000
Negative Equity:         $3,000
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:          $25,000
($30,000 - $5,000 trade value)

Sales Tax (4.225%):      $1,056.25

Loan Amount:             $28,000
($30,000 - $5,000 trade + $3,000 negative equity)
```

**Key Point:**
The $3,000 negative equity is financed debt but is **NOT subject to sales tax**.

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT** (with down payment tax)

**Leasing Company Options:**

Missouri allows motor vehicle leasing companies to elect one of two tax treatment methods:

**Option A: Pay Tax on Vehicle Purchase**
- Leasing company pays full sales tax when purchasing vehicle
- No tax collected from lessee on lease payments

**Option B: Collect Tax on Lease Receipts** (Most Common)
- Leasing company purchases vehicle tax-free
- Sales tax collected from lessee on:
  - **Down payment** (capitalized cost reduction)
  - **Monthly lease payments**

**For Leases > 60 Days:**
- Tax based on **lessee's address**

**For Leases ≤ 60 Days:**
- Tax based on **leasing company's location**

**Leasing Company Registration:**
- Annual fee: $250
- Must apply for authority to collect and remit sales tax
- Receives 2% retention allowance on collected taxes

**Source:** RSMo 144.070, 12 CSR 10-103.350(5), Section 9 Lease/Rental (MO DOR)

---

### 2.2 Capitalized Cost Reduction (Down Payment) Taxability

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE**

**How It Works:**
- Sales tax is charged on the **full down payment amount**
- Tax is due **at lease signing** (part of "due at signing" amount)
- Tax applies to all forms of cap cost reduction:
  - Cash down payment
  - Trade-in allowance
  - Manufacturer rebates applied to cap cost

**Example:**
```
Cap Cost Reduction:      $3,000
Sales Tax Rate:          8.73% (Kansas City)
Tax on Down Payment:     $261.90
─────────────────────────────
Due at Signing:          $3,261.90
(plus first month payment, fees, etc.)
```

**Source:** 12 CSR 10-103.350(5)(A), Car Lease Tax Rules by State

---

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Treatment:** **TAXABLE** (as part of cap cost reduction)

**How It Works:**
- Trade-in value applied to lease **reduces capitalized cost**
- However, the trade-in value itself is **subject to sales tax** when applied as cap cost reduction
- Different treatment than purchase (where trade-in is fully exempt)

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:          $35,000
Trade-In Allowance:      $5,000
Net Cap Cost:            $30,000
─────────────────────────────
Tax on Trade-In:         $5,000 × 8.73% = $436.50
(due at signing)

Tax on Monthly Payment:  $450 × 8.73% = $39.29
(per month)
```

**Source:** 12 CSR 10-103.350(5)(A)

---

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability (VSC, GAP on Leases)

**Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC):**
- **NOT TAXABLE** if separately stated and optional
- Same rules as retail purchases

**GAP Insurance/Waiver:**
- **NOT TAXABLE** (insurance products exempt)
- GAP waivers (non-insurance versions) may have different treatment - consult tax advisor

**Monthly Payment Impact:**
- If VSC or GAP is rolled into monthly payment, that portion is taxable
- Best practice: Charge separately to avoid tax

**Example:**
```
Base Monthly Payment:    $400  (taxable)
VSC (separately charged): $50  (NOT taxable if itemized)
GAP (insurance):         $30  (NOT taxable)
─────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:          $400
Sales Tax (8.73%):       $34.92
Total Monthly Bill:      $480 + $34.92 = $514.92
```

**Source:** Missouri sales tax exemptions, service contract rules

---

### 2.5 Documentary Fee Treatment on Leases

**Treatment:** Same as retail purchases

- **Cap:** $604.47 (2025)
- **Taxability:** TAXABLE
- Doc fee is included in taxable "lease receipts"
- Typically charged at lease inception and subject to sales tax

**Source:** RSMo 301.558, 12 CSR 10-26.231

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid to Other States

**Policy:** **YES** - Missouri provides credit for sales/use taxes paid to other states

**Requirements:**

**90-Day Rule:**
- If vehicle is registered in another state and **regularly operated there for at least 90 days** prior to Missouri registration:
  - **NO Missouri tax is due**

**Within 90 Days:**
- If vehicle is brought to Missouri **within 90 days** of registering in another state:
  - Missouri tax **IS due**
  - **CREDIT given** for taxes paid to other state
  - Pay only the difference (if Missouri rate is higher)

**Formula:**
```
Missouri Tax Due = (MO Rate × Purchase Price) - Tax Paid to Other State
If result is negative or zero, no additional tax due
```

**Example 1: No Tax Due (90+ Days)**
```
Purchase in Illinois:     $30,000
Registered in IL:         January 1, 2025
Operated in IL:           90+ days
Brought to MO:            April 15, 2025
─────────────────────────────
Missouri Tax Due:         $0
```

**Example 2: Credit Applied (<90 Days)**
```
Purchase in Kansas:       $30,000
KS Sales Tax Paid:        $675 (2.25%)
Registered in KS:         February 1, 2025
Brought to MO:            March 15, 2025 (43 days)
MO Tax Rate:              8.73% (Kansas City)
─────────────────────────────
MO Tax Owed:              $2,619.00
Credit for KS Tax:        -$675.00
Net MO Tax Due:           $1,944.00
```

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of tax paid to other state
- Registration documentation showing dates
- For trade-ins on out-of-state purchases: proof of trade-in to receive credit in Missouri

### 3.2 Special Rules and Limitations

**30-Day Out-of-State Title Rule:**
- If vehicle is purchased and **titled out-of-state within 30 days** of purchase before titling in Missouri:
  - **NO Missouri tax is due**

**No Tax Due Scenarios:**
1. Vehicle registered and operated in another state for 90+ days
2. Vehicle titled out-of-state within 30 days of purchase

**Credit Limitations:**
- Credit applies only to **sales/use tax** paid, not other fees or taxes
- Maximum credit is the amount that would have been due in Missouri
- No refund if other state's tax was higher than Missouri's

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 Special Schemes and Unusual Rules

**1. Dealer Sales Tax Collection Mandate (2022 Law - Implementation Pending)**

**Background:**
- Missouri was the **50th state** to require dealer sales tax collection
- Previously, buyers had 30 days to pay tax at DMV after purchase with temporary tags

**New Law (Senate Bill 28, signed 2025):**
- **Dealers must collect sales tax at point of sale** before issuing temporary tags
- Makes Missouri the **48th state** with dealer collection requirement

**Implementation Status:**
- Law signed and effective **August 28, 2025**
- **HOWEVER:** Full implementation delayed until FUSION system operational
- FUSION (Fifty Unique Systems In One Nexus) is Missouri DOR's new vehicle registration/titling system
- Expected to be operational: **Late 2026 or early 2027**
- Until FUSION is live, **current process continues** (buyer pays at DMV within 30 days)

**Temporary Tag Changes:**
- Old system: 90-day temporary tags available
- New system:
  - Standard: **30-day tags**
  - Dealers with $100,000 bond: **60-day tags**

**2. Total Loss Tax Credit Program**

If a vehicle is declared a total loss by insurance:
- Purchaser can **offset insurance payoff amount plus deductible** against replacement vehicle price
- Tax paid only on the **difference**
- Must purchase replacement within **180 days** of total loss payment
- File **Sales Tax Credit Affidavit** (typically provided by insurer) with Missouri DOR

**Example:**
```
Total Loss Payoff:       $15,000
Deductible:              $500
Total Credit:            $15,500

Replacement Vehicle:     $25,000
Taxable Amount:          $9,500
($25,000 - $15,500)
```

**3. Agricultural Vehicle Trade-Ins**

- Farmers may trade **grain or livestock** they produced for agricultural vehicles
- Must purchase from licensed motor vehicle dealer
- Unique provision not found in most states

**4. All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) Sales**

- Sales of ATVs by **non-dealers** are subject to sales tax only if purchase price **exceeds $3,000**
- Below $3,000: no tax due on private-party ATV sales

**5. Gifted Vehicle Exemption**

- Vehicles received as **bona fide gifts** are exempt from sales tax
- Must provide gift statement/affidavit
- Common for family transfers

**6. Repossession Tax Liability**

- If dealer repossesses vehicle **before titling**, purchaser still owes sales tax
- Exception: Dealer agrees **in writing** to void sale and return all payments and trade-in
- Unusual rule that protects state tax revenue

### 4.2 Tax Caps or Limits

**No Vehicle Sales Tax Cap:**
Missouri does **NOT cap** the amount of sales tax due on vehicle purchases. Tax is calculated on the full taxable purchase price regardless of amount.

**Documentary Fee Cap:** $604.47 (2025) - See Section 1.5

### 4.3 Kansas City vs. St. Louis Differences

**Rate Differences:**

| Feature | Kansas City | St. Louis City | St. Louis County |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------------|

| Local Rate Range | 4.505% - 7.755% | 5.425% - 7.425% | 2.26% - 4.765% |
| **Total Range** | **8.73% - 11.98%** | **9.68% - 11.68%** | **8.99% - 11.00%** |

**No Substantive Differences:**
- Both follow same state rules for trade-ins, rebates, leasing
- Tax jurisdiction based on buyer's address, not dealer location
- No special exemptions or programs unique to either metro area

**Why Rates Vary:**
- Different local sales tax rates

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR AUTOLYTIQ

### 6.1 Tax Calculation Logic

**Retail Purchase Formula:**
```typescript
interface MORetailTaxCalc {
  vehiclePrice: number;
  tradeInValue: number;
  manufacturerRebate: number;
  dealerRebate: number;
  docFee: number;
  accessories: number;
  vscPrice: number; // separately stated
  gapPrice: number; // insurance product

  // Calculation:
  taxableAmount = vehiclePrice
                - tradeInValue
                - manufacturerRebate
                - dealerRebate
                + docFee
                + accessories;
                // VSC and GAP NOT taxable if separate

  salesTax = taxableAmount * localTaxRate; // rate from buyer's address
}
```

**Lease Formula:**
```typescript
interface MOLeaseTaxCalc {
  capCostReduction: number; // down payment + trade + rebates
  monthlyPayment: number;
  docFee: number;

  // Calculation:
  downPaymentTax = capCostReduction * localTaxRate;
  monthlyTax = monthlyPayment * localTaxRate;

  totalTaxDueAtSigning = downPaymentTax + monthlyTax;
  totalTaxOverLife = downPaymentTax + (monthlyTax * term);
}
```

### 6.2 Rate Table Integration

**Requirements:**
1. Maintain Missouri DOR rate table (updated annually)
2. Geocode buyer address to determine correct local rate
3. State rate: 4.225% (hardcoded until changed by statute)
4. Local rate: lookup by county + city + special districts

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET https://dor.mo.gov/pdf/localsales.pdf
```

**Fallback:**
- If exact rate unavailable, use county-level minimum rate
- Provide disclaimer: "Estimated rate - verify with Missouri DOR"

---

### 6.3 Doc Fee Cap Enforcement

**Business Rules:**
1. Maximum doc fee: $604.47 (2025)
2. Check for annual update each January (published in Missouri Register)
3. Alert dealer if doc fee exceeds cap
4. Auto-update cap from 12 CSR 10-26.231

**API Check:**
```typescript
const MO_DOC_FEE_CAP_2025 = 604.47;

function validateDocFee(fee: number, year: number): boolean {
  const cap = getDocFeeCap(year); // lookup from database
  return fee <= cap;
}
```

---

### 6.4 Trade-In Credit Validation

**Business Rules:**
1. Full trade-in credit allowed (no cap)
2. If trade-in value > vehicle price → tax = $0
3. Out-of-state purchase: require trade-in proof upload
4. Lease: trade-in IS taxable (different from purchase)

**UI Considerations:**
- Show tax savings from trade-in in Deal Studio
- Highlight: "Trade-in saves you $X in sales tax"

---

### 6.5 Reciprocity Calculation

**Business Rules:**
1. Capture:
   - Purchase date
   - Other state registration date
   - Date brought to Missouri
2. Calculate days between registration and MO registration
3. If >= 90 days → tax = $0
4. If < 90 days → calculate credit

**Formula:**
```typescript
interface MOReciprocityCalc {
  moTaxRate: number;
  purchasePrice: number;
  otherStateTaxPaid: number;
  daysInOtherState: number;

  // Calculation:
  if (daysInOtherState >= 90) {
    moTaxDue = 0;
  } else {
    grossMoTax = purchasePrice * moTaxRate;
    moTaxDue = Math.max(0, grossMoTax - otherStateTaxPaid);
  }
}
```

---

### 6.6 Future Law Change Alert

**CRITICAL:** Monitor FUSION system launch (late 2026/early 2027)

**When FUSION Goes Live:**
- Dealer collection becomes mandatory
- Sales tax must be collected at point of sale
- Integration with Missouri DOR API will be required
- Temporary tag issuance may require tax payment confirmation

**Action Items:**
1. Subscribe to Missouri DOR dealer updates
2. Monitor FUSION implementation timeline
3. Plan for API integration with Missouri DOR system
4. Update sales process workflows to collect tax upfront
