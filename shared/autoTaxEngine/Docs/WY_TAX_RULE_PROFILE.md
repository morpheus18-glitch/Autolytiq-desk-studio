```

**Source:** WY § 39-15-101, WY DOR Sales Tax Guide

Manufacturer Rebate:     -$2,000
───────────────────────────────
Taxable Base:            $23,000
Sales Tax @ 5.0%:        $1,150
```

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION** (pure monthly method)

Wyoming taxes leases on each monthly payment. No upfront tax on capitalized cost reductions.

**Tax Rate:** Same as retail (4.0% state + county/city)
- Combined rate 4.0% to 6.0%

### 2.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions are **NOT TAXED** separately

Down payments, rebates, and trade-ins reduce the capitalized cost, which lowers monthly payments, which reduces total tax paid over the lease term.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:          $35,000
Trade-In:                -$8,000
Cash Down:               -$5,000
───────────────────────────────
Net Cap Cost:            $22,000
Monthly Payment:         $350
Monthly Tax @ 5.0%:      $17.50
Total Tax (36 months):   $630.00
```

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT**

Trade-ins reduce capitalized cost, lowering monthly payments and total tax.

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Service Contracts (VSC):** NOT taxable
**GAP Insurance:** NOT taxable
**Doc Fee:** TAXABLE (if capitalized, taxed monthly; if upfront, taxed immediately)
