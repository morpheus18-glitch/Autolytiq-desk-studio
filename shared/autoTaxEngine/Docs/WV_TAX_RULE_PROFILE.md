## Executive Summary

West Virginia employs a **Motor Vehicle Privilege Tax** system for vehicle registration, which is fundamentally different from traditional sales tax. The Privilege Tax is a **registration tax paid at the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**, with a **base rate of 5%** for most vehicles. The tax base is the **higher of purchase price or DMV-assessed value**, and the tax is **state-only with no local jurisdiction rates**.

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- Motor Vehicle Privilege Tax at 5% base rate (state-only, no local rates)
- Tax base = higher of purchase price or DMV-assessed value
- Vehicle class-specific rates: RV (6%), Trailer (3%), Standard (5%)
- Full trade-in credit (reduces privilege tax base)
- Manufacturer rebates reduce taxable amount (dealer rebates do not)
- **Service contracts and GAP ARE TAXABLE** (unlike most states)
- Documentation fees are subject to privilege tax
- Leases taxed at 5% on monthly payments
- Reciprocity credit available (capped at WV privilege tax amount)
- Tax paid at DMV when registering vehicle

## 1. PRIVILEGE TAX OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What is Privilege Tax?

The **Motor Vehicle Privilege Tax** is West Virginia's registration tax for motor vehicles. It is **NOT a sales tax** but rather a privilege tax for the right to operate a motor vehicle on West Virginia roads. The tax is codified in **West Virginia Code Chapter 17A - Motor Vehicles**.

**Critical Differences from Sales Tax:**
- **Nature:** Registration/privilege tax (not sales tax)
- **Rate:** 5% base (varies by vehicle class)
- **Tax Base:** Higher of purchase price or DMV-assessed value
- **Collection Point:** Paid at WV DMV when registering vehicle
- **Jurisdiction:** State-only (no county or city add-ons)
- **Purpose:** Revenue supports DMV operations and state road fund

### 1.2 Tax Rates by Vehicle Class

**Base Rate:** 5.0% of purchase price (or assessed value, whichever is higher)

**Vehicle Class-Specific Rates:**
| Vehicle Class | Privilege Tax Rate | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Passenger Cars** | 5.0% | Standard rate |
| **Light Trucks** | 5.0% | Pickups, SUVs under 10,000 lbs |
| **Motorcycles** | 5.0% | Standard rate |
| **Recreational Vehicles (RV)** | 6.0% | Higher rate for RVs, motorhomes |
| **Trailers** | 3.0% | Lower rate for trailers |
| **Heavy Trucks** | 5.0% | Commercial vehicles over 10,000 lbs |

**Important:** The vehicle class determines the applicable rate. RVs pay a 1% premium, while trailers receive a 2% discount.

### 1.3 Tax Base Calculation

**Critical Feature:** Tax base is the **HIGHER of**:
1. **Purchase Price** (net of trade-in and manufacturer rebates), OR
2. **DMV-Assessed Value** (state-determined book value)

**Formula:**
```
Tax Base = MAX(Purchase Price - Trade-In - Mfr Rebates, DMV Assessed Value)
Privilege Tax = Tax Base × Rate (5%, 6%, or 3% depending on class)
```

**Example:**
```
Purchase Price:                $15,000
Trade-In:                      -$8,000
Net Price:                      $7,000
DMV Assessed Value:            $12,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax Base (higher of two):      $12,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:               $600
```

**Why This Matters:** Even if you negotiate a great deal or have a large trade-in, you may still pay privilege tax based on DMV's assessed value if it's higher than your net purchase price.

### 1.4 Legal Basis

- **Primary Statute:** West Virginia Code Chapter 17A - Motor Vehicles
- **WV Code § 17A-3-4:** Tax Imposed
- **WV Code § 17A-3-5:** Tax Rates by Vehicle Class
- **WV Code § 17A-3-6:** Trade-In Credit
- **WV Code § 17A-3-7:** Credit for Tax Paid to Other States

**Administrative Authority:**
- West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
- West Virginia State Tax Department (certain exemptions)

---

## 2. RETAIL SALES TAX (PRIVILEGE TAX)

### 2.1 Tax Base Calculation

**Privilege Tax Base Formula:**
```
Net Purchase Price = Purchase Price
                   - Trade-In Allowance
                   - Manufacturer Rebates
                   + Taxable Dealer Fees
                   + Negative Equity (if applicable)

DMV Assessed Value = [State-determined book value]

Tax Base = MAX(Net Purchase Price, DMV Assessed Value)

Privilege Tax = Tax Base × Rate (5%, 6%, or 3%)
```

### 2.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT**

West Virginia allows **full trade-in credit** against privilege tax. The trade-in value is deducted from the purchase price before calculating the privilege tax (subject to the higher-of rule with DMV assessed value).

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:               -$12,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Purchase Price:            $18,000
DMV Assessed Value:            $22,000
Tax Base (higher):             $22,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,100
```

**Legal Basis:** WV Code § 17A-3-6 - "The purchase price shall be reduced by the value of any motor vehicle taken in trade."

**No Cap:** There is no maximum trade-in credit amount.

### 2.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** (reduces purchase price)

Manufacturer rebates, incentives, and cash-back offers **reduce the net purchase price** before privilege tax calculation (subject to the higher-of rule).

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$4,000
Net Price:                     $31,000
DMV Assessed Value:            $28,000
Tax Base (higher):             $31,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,550
```

**Legal Basis:** West Virginia interprets manufacturer rebates as purchase price reductions under WV Code § 17A-3-4.

### 2.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (does not reduce purchase price)

Dealer rebates, dealer incentives, and dealer cash-back offers are considered post-sale incentives and do **NOT reduce the privilege tax base**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Dealer Rebate:                 -$2,000 (NOT deducted for tax)
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax Base:                      $30,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,500

Customer receives $2,000 dealer rebate after tax is paid.
```

### 2.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

Dealer documentation fees, processing fees, and similar dealer charges **ARE subject to privilege tax**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Doc Fee:                          $595
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Price (before trade):      $28,595
DMV Assessed Value:            $25,000
Tax Base (higher):             $28,595
Privilege Tax @ 5%:            $1,429.75
```

**No Cap:** West Virginia does not impose a statutory cap on dealer documentation fees. Fees typically range from $300 to $600+.

### 2.6 Title and Registration Fees

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

Government fees for title and registration are **NOT subject to privilege tax**.

**Current Fees (2025):**
- **Title Fee:** $15.00
- **License Plate Fee:** $51.50 (passenger car)
- **Registration Fee:** $30.00 (annual, varies by vehicle weight)
- **Privilege Tax:** 5% of purchase price (or assessed value)

**Total Due at WV DMV:**
```
Vehicle Price (after trade):   $22,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,100
Title Fee:                        $15
Plate Fee:                      $51.50
Registration Fee:                 $30
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Due:                     $1,196.50
```

### 2.7 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** ⚠️ (UNIQUE TO WEST VIRGINIA)

**CRITICAL:** Extended warranties, vehicle service contracts (VSC), and maintenance agreements **ARE subject to privilege tax** in West Virginia.

**This is DIFFERENT from most states**, which exempt service contracts as insurance products.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000
Service Contract:              +$2,500 (TAXED)
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax Base:                      $30,500
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,525
```

**Legal Basis:** Service contracts are considered part of the vehicle purchase price for privilege tax purposes under WV Code § 17A-3-4.

**Impact:** Buyers pay an additional 5% on service contract costs, making VSC more expensive than in states where they're exempt.

### 2.8 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** ⚠️ (UNIQUE TO WEST VIRGINIA)

**CRITICAL:** GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance **IS subject to privilege tax** in West Virginia.

**This is DIFFERENT from most states**, which exempt GAP as an insurance product.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
GAP Insurance:                    $795 (TAXED)
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax Base:                      $30,795
Privilege Tax @ 5%:            $1,539.75
```

**Legal Basis:** GAP is considered part of the vehicle transaction and subject to privilege tax under WV Code § 17A-3-4.

**Impact:** Buyers pay an additional 5% on GAP costs.

### 2.9 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (if included in vehicle sale)

Accessories installed by the dealer and included in the vehicle sale are **subject to privilege tax**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $27,000
Accessories (lift kit, wheels,
  bed liner, audio):           +$3,500
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax Base:                      $30,500
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,525
```

**Timing Matters:** If accessories are sold separately after the vehicle sale, they may be subject to general sales tax (6% + local) instead of privilege tax. Best practice depends on comparative rates.

### 2.10 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** (added to purchase price)

Negative equity from a trade-in (when trade-in payoff exceeds trade-in value) is **added to the privilege tax base**.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $28,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000
Trade-In Payoff:              -$14,000
Negative Equity:               -$4,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Vehicle Price:             $18,000 ($28k - $10k trade)
Negative Equity Added:         +$4,000
Tax Base:                      $22,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,100

Amount Financed:               $23,100 ($22,000 + $1,100 tax)
```

**Legal Reasoning:** Negative equity increases the amount financed and is considered part of the total consideration paid for the vehicle.

## 3. LEASE TAXATION (PRIVILEGE TAX ON MONTHLY PAYMENTS)

### 3.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION**

West Virginia applies **5% privilege tax to each monthly lease payment** (or vehicle class rate: 6% for RV, 3% for trailer). This is a **monthly taxation method** with no upfront tax on capitalized cost reduction.

**Key Features:**
- 5% privilege tax on each monthly payment (base rate)
- No local rates (state-only)
- No upfront privilege tax on down payments or cap cost reduction
- Tax paid monthly as part of lease payment
- Same 5% rate as retail privilege tax (for standard vehicles)

### 3.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXED**

Capitalized cost reductions (cash down, trade-in equity, rebates) are **NOT subject to privilege tax** on leases.

**Example:**
```
Gross Capitalized Cost:        $35,000
Cap Cost Reduction:
  Cash Down:                   -$4,000 (NOT taxed)
  Trade-In:                    -$6,000 (NOT taxed)
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $25,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $425
Monthly Privilege Tax @ 5%:     $21.25
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $446.25
```

### 3.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT**

Trade-ins reduce the capitalized cost on leases, lowering the monthly payment and thus the monthly privilege tax.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $40,000
Trade-In Allowance:           -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $30,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $500
Monthly Privilege Tax @ 5%:       $25
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:            $525
```

**Advantage:** Trade-ins on leases receive the same full credit as retail purchases, reducing the cap cost and lowering monthly privilege tax.

### 3.4 Rebates on Leases

**Policy:** **FOLLOW RETAIL RULE**

Rebates on leases are treated the same as retail:
- **Manufacturer rebates:** Reduce cap cost (not taxed)
- **Dealer rebates:** Do not reduce taxable payments

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $38,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$3,000 (reduces cap cost)
Dealer Rebate:                 -$1,000 (does NOT reduce cap cost)
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $35,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $475
Monthly Privilege Tax @ 5%:     $23.75
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $498.75

Customer receives $1,000 dealer rebate separately.
```

### 3.5 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Policy:** ⚠️ **VSC and GAP ARE TAXABLE** (UNIQUE)

| Product | Taxable? | Treatment |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Service Contracts (VSC)** | ✅ YES | Subject to 5% privilege tax when capitalized |
| **GAP Insurance** | ✅ YES | Subject to 5% privilege tax when capitalized |
| **Doc Fee** | ✅ YES | Subject to 5% privilege tax |

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Service Contract (cap'd):      +$1,800 (TAXED)
GAP Insurance (cap'd):           +$695 (TAXED)
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $37,495

Monthly Payment (base):           $525
Monthly Privilege Tax @ 5%:     $26.25
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $551.25

⚠️ VSC and GAP ARE taxed when capitalized into lease.
This increases monthly payment and thus monthly privilege tax.
```

**Impact:** Capitalizing VSC and GAP into a lease increases the monthly payment, which increases the monthly privilege tax. This is a significant cost difference from states where these products are exempt.

### 3.6 Documentation Fee on Leases

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

Doc fees on leases are subject to 5% privilege tax.

**Example:**
```
Doc Fee:                          $595
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $29.75
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Doc Fee Cost:             $624.75
```

### 3.7 Negative Equity on Leases

**Policy:** **TAXABLE**

Negative equity increases the capitalized cost, which increases monthly payments and thus monthly privilege tax.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:                $35,000
Negative Equity:               +$4,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $39,000

Monthly Payment (base):           $550
Monthly Privilege Tax @ 5%:       $27.50
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:            $577.50
```

## 4. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 4.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** **LIMITED RECIPROCITY** (credit capped at WV privilege tax)

West Virginia provides **credit for sales tax or similar tax paid to another state**, capped at the WV privilege tax amount.

**Legal Basis:** WV Code § 17A-3-7 - Credit for Tax Paid to Another State

### 4.2 How Credits Work

**Scenario 1: Other State Tax ≥ WV Privilege Tax**

If sales/use tax paid to another state equals or exceeds WV privilege tax, **NO additional privilege tax is due**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Ohio:
OH Sales Tax Paid (5.75%):        $1,725 on $30,000 vehicle
WV Privilege Tax (5%):            $1,500
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                   $1,500 (capped at WV tax)
WV Privilege Tax Due:                 $0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Tax < WV Privilege Tax**

If tax paid to another state is less than WV privilege tax, pay the **DIFFERENCE**.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana:
MT Sales Tax Paid (0%):               $0
WV Privilege Tax (5%):            $1,500
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                       $0
WV Privilege Tax Due:             $1,500
```

### 4.3 Documentation Required

To claim reciprocity credit, you must provide:
- Proof of tax paid to other state (receipt, invoice, registration)
- Bill of sale showing vehicle price
- Prior state's title or registration
- Evidence of legal payment (not voluntary)

### 4.4 Credit Cap

**Rule:** Credit is capped at the WV privilege tax amount (5% of purchase price or assessed value).

You receive credit up to WV's tax amount, but you **don't get a refund** if you paid more in another state.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Tennessee:
TN Sales Tax Paid (7%):           $2,100 on $30,000 vehicle
WV Privilege Tax (5%):            $1,500
─────────────────────────────────────────
Credit Allowed:                   $1,500 (capped at WV tax)
WV Privilege Tax Due:                 $0
Excess TN Tax:                      $600 (no refund)
```

## 5. UNIQUE WEST VIRGINIA FEATURES

### 5.1 Privilege Tax vs. Sales Tax System

**Feature:** West Virginia uses privilege tax exclusively for vehicles (not sales tax)

**Why Unique:**
- Privilege tax is a registration tax (paid at DMV)
- Different from sales tax (which would be paid at dealership)
- Lower rate than general sales tax (5% vs. 6% + local)
- State-only rate (no local jurisdiction stacking)

**Comparison:**
| Item | Tax Type | Rate | Collection Point |
|------|----------|------|------------------|
| **Motor Vehicles** | Privilege Tax | 5.0% | WV DMV |
| **General Retail** | Sales Tax | 6.0% + up to 1% local | Point of sale |

### 5.2 Tax Base = Higher of Price or Assessed Value

**Feature:** Tax base is the **HIGHER of purchase price or DMV-assessed value**

**Why Critical:**
- Even with great deals or large trade-ins, minimum tax is based on assessed value
- Prevents tax avoidance through low-ball pricing
- DMV uses state book values (similar to NADA or KBB)

**Example:**
```
Scenario: Great deal on used truck
Purchase Price:                $18,000
Trade-In:                     -$12,000
Net Price:                      $6,000
DMV Assessed Value:            $15,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Tax Base (higher):             $15,000
Privilege Tax @ 5%:               $750

Without assessed value rule, tax would be:
$6,000 × 5% = $300 (saves $450)

With assessed value rule:
$15,000 × 5% = $750
```

### 5.3 Service Contracts and GAP ARE Taxable

**Feature:** ⚠️ **VSC and GAP are subject to privilege tax** (UNIQUE)

**Why Notable:**
- Most states exempt VSC and GAP as insurance products
- West Virginia taxes them as part of the vehicle transaction
- Increases cost of backend F&I products by 5%

**Impact Example:**
```
Service Contract:              $2,500
GAP Insurance:                   $795
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Backend Products:        $3,295

WV Privilege Tax @ 5%:         $164.75
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Cost with Tax:           $3,459.75

In exempt states (e.g., NC, AZ):
Total Cost:                    $3,295 (no tax)
WV Premium:                    $164.75 (5% more)
```

### 5.4 Vehicle Class-Specific Rates

**Feature:** Different rates for different vehicle classes

**Rates:**
- **RV/Motorhome:** 6% (premium rate)
- **Trailer:** 3% (discount rate)
- **Standard:** 5% (passenger cars, trucks, motorcycles)

**Example - RV Purchase:**
```
RV Purchase Price:             $120,000
Trade-In:                      -$40,000
Net Price:                      $80,000
Privilege Tax @ 6%:              $4,800
```

**Example - Trailer Purchase:**
```
Trailer Price:                  $15,000
Privilege Tax @ 3%:                $450
```

### 5.5 No Local Rates

**Feature:** Privilege tax is state-only (no county or city add-ons)

**Why Unique:**
- Simplifies calculation (no jurisdiction lookup needed)
- Same rate statewide (5%, 6%, or 3% depending on class)
- No dealer location dependency

**Advantage:** Easy to calculate, no dealer location or buyer residence considerations for tax rate.

### 5.6 Collection at DMV

**Feature:** Privilege tax is paid at WV DMV when registering (not at dealership)

**Process:**
1. Buyer purchases vehicle at dealership
2. Buyer takes bill of sale and paperwork to WV DMV
3. Privilege tax is calculated and paid at DMV
4. DMV issues title and registration

**Why Different:** Most states collect sales tax at dealership point-of-sale. WV's DMV collection ensures compliance and ties tax payment to registration.

## 7. CALCULATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Retail Purchase - New Vehicle with Trade-In

**Scenario:**

+ Doc Fee:                        +$595
+ Service Contract:             +$2,200 (TAXED in WV)
+ GAP:                            +$795 (TAXED in WV)
- Trade-In:                   -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Purchase Price:            $25,590

STEP 2: Check DMV Assessed Value
─────────────────────────────────────
DMV Assessed Value:            $28,000 (assumed)
Net Purchase Price:            $25,590
Tax Base (higher):             $28,000

STEP 3: Calculate Privilege Tax
─────────────────────────────────────
Privilege Tax @ 5%:             $1,400

STEP 4: Non-Taxable Items
─────────────────────────────────────
Title Fee:                        $15
Plate Fee:                      $51.50
Registration:                     $30
─────────────────────────────────────
Non-Taxable Total:              $96.50

STEP 5: Total Due
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Vehicle Cost:              $25,590
Privilege Tax:                  $1,400
Non-Taxable Fees:               $96.50
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Due:                     $27,086.50
```

### Example 2: Retail Purchase - Used Car (Assessed Value Higher)

**Scenario:**
- Used vehicle purchase price: $12,000
- Trade-in: $5,000
- Doc fee: $450
- DMV assessed value: $14,000

**Calculation:**
```
STEP 1: Calculate Net Purchase Price
─────────────────────────────────────
Vehicle Price:                 $12,000
+ Doc Fee:                        +$450
- Trade-In:                    -$5,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Net Purchase Price:             $7,450

STEP 2: Check DMV Assessed Value
─────────────────────────────────────
DMV Assessed Value:            $14,000
Net Purchase Price:             $7,450
Tax Base (higher):             $14,000 ⚠️

STEP 3: Calculate Privilege Tax
─────────────────────────────────────
Privilege Tax @ 5%:               $700

⚠️ Despite net price of $7,450, privilege tax is based
   on DMV assessed value of $14,000.

   Without higher-of rule: $7,450 × 5% = $372.50
   With higher-of rule:    $14,000 × 5% = $700
   Additional tax:         $327.50
```

### 9.2 Calculation Logic - RETAIL

```
STEP 1: Calculate Net Purchase Price
  Net_Price = Sale_Price
            - Trade_In_Value
            - Manufacturer_Rebates
            + Doc_Fee
            + Service_Contract_Amount  ⚠️ TAXABLE
            + GAP_Amount              ⚠️ TAXABLE
            + Negative_Equity

STEP 2: Lookup DMV Assessed Value
  Assessed_Value = [DMV book value lookup]

STEP 3: Calculate Tax Base
  Tax_Base = MAX(Net_Price, Assessed_Value)

STEP 4: Determine Rate by Vehicle Class
  Rate = 5% (standard)
       | 6% (RV)
       | 3% (trailer)

STEP 5: Calculate Privilege Tax
  Privilege_Tax = Tax_Base × Rate

STEP 6: Non-Taxable Items
  Title_Fee = $15
  Plate_Fee = $51.50 (standard)
  Registration = Variable

STEP 7: Total Due
  Total = Tax_Base + Privilege_Tax + Title_Fee + Plate_Fee + Registration
```

### 9.3 Calculation Logic - LEASE

```
STEP 1: Calculate Adjusted Cap Cost
  Adj_Cap_Cost = Gross_Cap_Cost
               - Cash_Down
               - Trade_In
               - Manufacturer_Rebates
               + Service_Contract    ⚠️ TAXED if capitalized
               + GAP                 ⚠️ TAXED if capitalized

STEP 2: Calculate Monthly Privilege Tax
  Monthly_Tax = Monthly_Payment × Rate (5%, 6%, or 3%)

STEP 3: Calculate Doc Fee Tax (Upfront)
  Doc_Fee_Tax = Doc_Fee × Rate

STEP 4: Total Monthly Payment
  Total_Monthly = Monthly_Payment + Monthly_Tax

STEP 5: Total Lease Privilege Tax
  Total_Tax = Doc_Fee_Tax + (Monthly_Tax × Lease_Term_Months)
```
