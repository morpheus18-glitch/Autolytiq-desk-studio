## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION** (pure monthly method)

South Dakota taxes leases on each monthly payment. No upfront tax on capitalized cost reductions.

**Tax Rate:** Same as retail (4.0% state + municipal)

### 2.2 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions are **NOT TAXED** separately

Down payments, rebates, and trade-ins reduce the capitalized cost, which lowers monthly payments, which reduces total tax paid over the lease term.

**Example:**
```
Gross Cap Cost:          $35,000
Trade-In:                -$8,000
Cash Down:               -$5,000
───────────────────────────────
Net Cap Cost:            $22,000
Monthly Payment:         $350
Monthly Tax @ 4.5%:      $15.75
Total Tax (36 months):   $567.00
```

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **FULL CREDIT**

Trade-ins reduce capitalized cost, lowering monthly payments and total tax.

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Service Contracts (VSC):** NOT taxable
**GAP Insurance:** NOT taxable
**Doc Fee:** TAXABLE (if capitalized, taxed monthly; if upfront, taxed immediately)

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** South Dakota provides **FULL RECIPROCAL CREDIT**

Credit is allowed for sales/use tax paid to other states, capped at SD tax amount.

**Example 1:** Other State Higher Rate
```
Vehicle purchased in California:  $30,000
California tax paid (7.5%):       $2,250
South Dakota tax would be (4.5%): $1,350
Credit allowed:                   $1,350
Additional SD tax due:            $0
```

**Example 2:** Other State Lower Rate
```

South Dakota tax due (4.5%):      $1,350
Credit allowed:                   $0
Additional SD tax due:            $1,350
```

**Documentation Required:**

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (Separate Annual Tax)

**IMPORTANT:** South Dakota has a SEPARATE annual excise tax on vehicles, distinct from the one-time sales tax.

**Excise Tax Schedule:**
- **Year 1:** 4% of vehicle value
- **Year 2:** 3% of vehicle value
- **Year 3:** 2% of vehicle value
- **Year 4+:** 1% of vehicle value

This is an annual tax paid at registration, NOT a sales tax.

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Value:       $30,000
Year 1 Excise Tax:       $1,200 (4%)
Year 2 Excise Tax:       $900 (3%)
Year 3 Excise Tax:       $600 (2%)
Year 4+ Excise Tax:      $300 (1%)
```

**Source:** SDCL § 10-46

### 4.2 No State Income Tax

South Dakota has NO personal income tax. The state relies on sales tax revenue to fund government operations.

This results in:
- Higher reliance on sales tax revenue
- Business-friendly environment
- Simple tax structure
- Among the lowest total tax burdens in the nation

South Dakota has among the LOWEST average doc fees in the nation ($200-250), compared to:

This reflects South Dakota's business-friendly, low-regulation environment.

### 4.4 Simple Tax Structure

- Flat 4% state rate
- Optional municipal rates (most 1-2%)
- No county taxes (unlike many states)
