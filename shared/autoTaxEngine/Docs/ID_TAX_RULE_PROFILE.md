## Tax Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Vehicle Purchase
```
Vehicle Price:           $30,000
Trade-In Value:          $10,000
Doc Fee:                 $389
Service Contract:        $2,000
Accessories:             $1,500

Calculation:
Taxable Base = $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
+ Doc Fee = $389
+ Accessories = $1,500
Taxable Amount = $21,889

Sales Tax (6%) = $21,889 × 0.06 = $1,313.34
Service Contract (not taxed) = $2,000

Total Tax: $1,313.34
Total Cost: $20,000 + $389 + $2,000 + $1,500 + $1,313.34 = $25,202.34
```

### Example 2: Purchase with Manufacturer Rebate
```
Vehicle Price:           $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:     $3,000
Trade-In Value:          $12,000
Doc Fee:                 $389
GAP Waiver:             $695

Calculation:
Price after Rebate = $35,000 - $3,000 = $32,000
Taxable Base = $32,000 - $12,000 = $20,000
+ Doc Fee = $389
Taxable Amount = $20,389

Sales Tax (6%) = $20,389 × 0.06 = $1,223.34
GAP Waiver (not taxed) = $695

Total Tax: $1,223.34
Total Cost: $20,000 + $389 + $695 + $1,223.34 = $22,307.34
```

### Example 3: Luxury Vehicle Purchase
```
Vehicle Price:           $75,000
Trade-In Value:          $30,000
Doc Fee:                 $389
Extended Warranty:       $4,500
Premium Accessories:     $5,000

Calculation:
Taxable Base = $75,000 - $30,000 = $45,000
+ Doc Fee = $389
+ Accessories = $5,000
Taxable Amount = $50,389

Sales Tax (6%) = $50,389 × 0.06 = $3,023.34
Extended Warranty (not taxed) = $4,500

Total Tax: $3,023.34
Total Cost: $45,000 + $389 + $4,500 + $5,000 + $3,023.34 = $57,912.34
```
