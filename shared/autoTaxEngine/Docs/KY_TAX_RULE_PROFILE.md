## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 State Tax Rate

**Rate:** 6% of the vehicle's purchase price (called "Motor Vehicle Usage Tax")
**Effective Date:** Long-standing rate (no recent changes)
**Legal Authority:** Kentucky Revised Statute § 138.460

Kentucky is a **one-rate state** with no local sales taxes on any purchases, including motor vehicles. The 6% rate is uniform statewide.

**Historical Context:**
- Kentucky has maintained a 6% motor vehicle usage tax rate for many years
- No recent legislative changes to the base rate
- The tax is technically a "usage tax" rather than a sales tax, imposed on the use of motor vehicles in Kentucky

### 1.2 Local Sales Tax

**IMPORTANT:** Kentucky has NO local sales taxes.

Unlike many states, Kentucky does not permit counties or cities to impose local option sales taxes. The 6% state rate is the only sales/use tax rate applicable to motor vehicles statewide.

### 1.3 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** Trade-in credit ALLOWED for used vehicles (effective July 1, 2014)

Kentucky law changed significantly on **July 1, 2014**, allowing trade-in value to reduce the taxable purchase price.

**Statutory Authority:** KRS 138.450(10) - Definition of "Total Consideration"

**Current Rules (Post-July 1, 2014):**
- Vehicles sold on or after July 1, 2014, are taxed based on the **purchase price reduced by the value of any vehicle(s) traded in**
- Trade-in allowance applies to **used vehicles only**
- **Both vehicles must be previously registered in Kentucky** (the vehicle being purchased and the vehicle being traded)
- Trade-in value allowed by dealer is deducted from purchase price
- No explicit cap on trade-in credit amount

**Out-of-State Purchases:**
- Originally, out-of-state purchases of used vehicles did NOT allow trade-in credit
- Recent guidance indicates out-of-state purchases of used vehicles **now allow for trade-in credit**

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:     $25,000
Trade-In Allowance:        -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────
Taxable Purchase Price:     $15,000
Tax @ 6%:                   $   900
```

**Important Limitation:**
The trade-in vehicle must have been **previously registered in Kentucky**. This means:
- Trading a Kentucky-registered vehicle for a new Kentucky vehicle: ✅ Credit allowed
- Trading an out-of-state registered vehicle: ⚠️ May not qualify for credit

### 1.4 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Treatment:** NOT taxable (rebates reduce taxable purchase price)

Kentucky taxes vehicle purchases **after rebates or incentives are applied** to the price, so buyers only pay sales tax on the net amount after the rebate is subtracted.

**How It Works:**
The taxable base is calculated as: Purchase Price - Manufacturer Rebates - Dealer Incentives

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:     $46,000
Manufacturer Rebate:        -$ 4,000
─────────────────────────────────
Taxable Purchase Price:     $42,000
Tax @ 6%:                   $ 2,520
(vs. $2,760 if rebate was taxable)
Savings from rebate:        $   240
```

**Key Point:** Kentucky does NOT tax rebates and dealer incentives. Buyers save both the face value of the rebate AND the tax on that amount.

**Source:** Kentucky Department of Revenue guidance; sales tax industry sources

### 1.5 Dealer Rebate/Incentive Treatment

**Treatment:** Dealer incentives reduce taxable price (same as manufacturer rebates)

Kentucky does not distinguish between manufacturer rebates and dealer incentives/holdbacks for tax purposes.

**Tax Calculation Formula:**
```
Taxable Price = Vehicle Price (before trade-ins but after incentives)
```

**Practical Application:**
- **Dealer cash paid to dealer by manufacturer:** Reduces purchase price if passed to customer
- **Dealer discount from advertised price:** Reduces purchase price (standard negotiation)
- **Any dealer participation in rebate programs:** Treated as manufacturer rebates

**Source:** Kentucky Department of Revenue guidance

### 1.6 Documentation Fee Taxability

**Treatment:** TAXABLE (included in gross receipts)

Documentation or processing fees are **subject to sales tax** in Kentucky.

**Official Guidance:**
Documentation or processing fees constitute a service that is part of the sale and are considered **gross receipts pursuant to KRS 139.050**, which means they are taxable and sales tax must be included.

**Doc Fee Cap:**
- Kentucky has **NO statutory cap** on documentation fees
- Average doc fee in Kentucky: **$315 to $450** (varies by dealer)
- Some sources cite fees as high as $450+
- Fees are set by dealerships, not regulated by state law

**States Comparison:**
- California, Illinois, Arkansas: Specify caps as taxable
- Iowa: Documentation fees are NOT taxable
- Kentucky: **Fees ARE taxable**, no cap

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:     $30,000
Doc Fee:                    $   400  ← Included in taxable base
─────────────────────────────────
Subtotal for Tax:           $30,400
Tax @ 6%:                   $ 1,824
```

### 1.7 Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Treatment:** TAXABLE (since July 1, 2018)

Vehicle Service Contracts (extended warranties) sold with motor vehicles ARE subject to Kentucky's 6% sales tax.

**Effective Date:** July 1, 2018 (House Bill 366/487 - 2018 Kentucky Tax Reform)

**Official Guidance:**
> "Effective July 1, 2018, receipts from the sale of extended warranty services, including the sale of optional service, maintenance, or extended warranty contracts related to taxable tangible personal property, shall be subject to sales and use tax."

**Definition:**
"Extended warranty services" means services provided through a service contract agreement between the contract provider and the purchaser where:
- The purchaser agrees to pay compensation for the contract
- The provider agrees to repair, replace, support, or maintain tangible personal property or digital property
- The service contract agreement is sold or purchased on or after July 1, 2018

**Key Points:**
- Sales tax applies to extended warranties covering **motor vehicles**
- Tax is charged on the **initial sale of the extended warranty contract itself**
- The 6% Kentucky sales tax rate applies
- Contracts sold **before July 1, 2018** are NOT taxable (grandfathered)

**2023 Expansion:**
As of 2023, the definition was expanded:
- Extended warranty services covering **real property** are now also taxable
- Language limiting taxability only to property subject to KRS 139 or motor vehicle usage tax has been **removed**

**Insurance Status:**
A service contract shall **NOT be considered a contract of insurance** per Kentucky House Bill 417 (2012). VSCs are explicitly defined as NOT insurance products in Kentucky law.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:     $35,000
VSC Premium:                $ 2,500  ← TAXABLE in KY
─────────────────────────────────
Subtotal for Tax:           $37,500
Tax @ 6%:                   $ 2,250
```

**Source:** Kentucky House Bill 366/487 (2018); Kentucky Sales Tax Facts (2018, 2022); KRS 139.010

### 1.8 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Treatment:** NOT taxable

Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance is **NOT subject to sales tax** in Kentucky.

**Official Guidance:**
> "The sale of GAP insurance and credit life insurance are not subject to sales tax."

**Distinction from VSC:**
- **VSC (Vehicle Service Contract):** Taxable at 6% (since July 1, 2018)
- **GAP Insurance:** NOT taxable (classified as insurance product)

GAP is classified as an **insurance product**, which is exempt from sales tax in Kentucky. This is an important distinction from VSCs, which are explicitly NOT considered insurance under Kentucky law.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:     $35,000
VSC Premium:                $ 2,500  ← TAXABLE
GAP Insurance:              $   895  ← NOT TAXABLE
─────────────────────────────────
Subtotal for Tax:           $37,500  (Vehicle + VSC only)
Tax @ 6%:                   $ 2,250
Total Out-the-Door:         $40,645
```

### 1.9 Accessories Taxability

**Treatment:** TAXABLE (parts and labor)

All accessories sold with a motor vehicle, including parts and labor for installation, are subject to the 6% sales tax.

**Official Guidance:**
Service charges for the installation of taxable repair parts are subject to sales and use tax. An example would be the necessary collection and remittance of sales tax on the sale of a bumper, as well as on any service, installation, or labor charges associated with the sale.

**What's Included:**
- Factory-installed accessories (included in base purchase price)
- Dealer-added accessories (running boards, mud flaps, cargo liners, floor mats, etc.)
- Aftermarket accessories installed before delivery
- Labor charges for installation
- Appearance packages (pinstriping, window tinting, paint protection film)
- Performance packages (exhaust systems, cold air intakes)
- Technology accessories (remote starters, navigation upgrades, dash cams)

**Regulatory Update (Effective February 1, 2022):**
The Kentucky Department of Revenue amended rules regarding the taxability of sales made by motor vehicle body shops. Key points:
- Parts sold by body shops are taxable
- Installation/labor charges associated with taxable parts are also taxable
- Sales tax applies to the bumper AND the labor to install it

**Exception:**
If the sale of tangible personal property, digital property, or service is **NOT taxable**, then any installation or labor charges associated with the sale will not be subject to tax either.

**Example:**
```
Base Vehicle Price:           $30,000
Running Boards + Install:     $    800
Window Tint + Install:        $    400
Bed Liner + Install:          $    600
─────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal:                     $31,800
Trade-In:                     -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Purchase Price:       $21,800
Tax @ 6%:                     $ 1,308
```

### 1.10 Negative Equity Treatment

**Treatment:** NOT explicitly addressed in Kentucky law (likely NOT taxable)

Kentucky statutes do not explicitly address whether negative equity rolled into a new vehicle loan is subject to sales tax.

**Legal Analysis:**

**Definition of "Retail Price" (KRS 138.450):**
For tax purposes, the retail price is defined as the **total consideration given** (the consideration is the total of the cash or amount financed and the value of any vehicle traded in) or 90% of the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), whichever is greater for new vehicles.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Amount Financed:** May include negative equity from previous loan
- **Purchase Price for Tax:** Consideration paid for the NEW vehicle

**Example (Conservative Interpretation):**
```
New Vehicle Price:              $30,000
Trade-In Actual Value:          $ 8,000
Trade-In Payoff (Negative):     $12,000
Negative Equity Rolled:         $ 4,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Amount Financed:                $26,000  ← NOT necessarily the taxable base
Purchase Price for Tax:         $22,000  ← Vehicle price minus trade value
Tax @ 6%:                       $ 1,320
```

**Ohio Comparison (Reference):**
Ohio has explicit guidance that if negative equity is included in the **total vehicle price** on the retail buyer's agreement, it will be taxed; if not, it won't be. Kentucky has no such published guidance.

**Best Practice:**
- Calculate tax on: New Vehicle Price - Trade-In Allowance
- Do NOT add negative equity to taxable base
- Clearly document on purchase agreement as separate financing matter
- For definitive guidance, contact Kentucky Department of Revenue

**Recommendation:** Contact the Kentucky Department of Revenue directly at (502) 564-4581 or consult Kentucky Revised Statute Chapter 138 for authoritative guidance on your specific situation.

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** MONTHLY taxation on gross receipts (ongoing basis)

Kentucky taxes motor vehicle leases on an **ongoing monthly basis** rather than requiring full upfront payment.

**Official Guidance:**
> "The retailer/lessor leasing tangible personal property within Kentucky must collect sales tax from the customer/lessee."

Kentucky Administrative Regulation **103 KAR 28.051** (Leases and Rentals) establishes that:
- Sales tax is collected on **gross lease or rental receipts**
- Tax is collected as payments are made (monthly)
- Lessor must collect and remit tax on an ongoing basis

**Tax Rate:** 6% (same as purchase rate)

**How It Works:**
Each monthly lease payment is subject to the 6% sales tax. The tax is calculated on the gross monthly payment amount, which includes:
- Base monthly payment
- Finance/interest charges
- Itemized charges passed on to lessee (property tax, insurance charges, etc.)

**Example:**
```
Base Monthly Lease Payment:    $450.00
Sales Tax @ 6%:                $ 27.00
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:         $477.00

Over 36 months:
Total Lease Payments:          $16,200.00
Total Sales Tax:               $   972.00
```

**Source:** Kentucky Administrative Regulation 103 KAR 28.051; Kentucky Department of Revenue

### 2.2 Capitalized Cost Reduction (Cap Cost Reduction)

**Treatment:** DOWN PAYMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO SALES TAX

In most states that collect motor vehicle tax due in full at the time of lease, if you make a down payment (Capitalized Cost Reduction) on your auto lease, you will be charged state and local sales tax on the down payment amount.

**What is Cap Cost Reduction?**
A capitalized cost reduction is the sum of:
- Any cash down payment
- Trade-in allowance
- Rebate
It is subtracted from the gross capitalized cost, leaving the adjusted capitalized cost.

**Kentucky Treatment:**
Based on federal guidance and general lease taxation principles, cap cost reductions (down payments) in Kentucky are subject to sales tax at the time of lease signing as part of the "due at lease signing" amount.

**Example:**
```
Capitalized Cost:                  $35,000
Cap Cost Reduction (cash down):    $ 3,000  ← Taxed upfront
Adjusted Cap Cost:                 $32,000
Residual Value:                    $20,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Depreciation Amount:               $12,000
Monthly Payment (36 months):       $  333.33
Monthly Tax @ 6%:                  $   20.00

Upfront Costs:
Down Payment:                      $ 3,000.00
Tax on Down Payment @ 6%:          $   180.00
First Month Payment:               $   333.33
Tax on First Month @ 6%:           $    20.00
─────────────────────────────────────────
Due at Signing:                    $ 3,533.33
```

**Source:** Federal Reserve guidance on vehicle leasing; 103 KAR 28.051

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Treatment:** Trade-in allowance reduces vehicle value (similar to purchases)

When a lessor accepts a used vehicle as part of a lease transaction, the trade-in allowance reduces the capitalized cost, which reduces the overall lease payments and therefore the total tax paid over the lease term.

**Requirements:**
1. Customer must own the trade-in (cannot trade-in a leased vehicle for tax benefit)
2. Trade directly to lessor named on the lease agreement
3. Trade-in value is determined by dealer/lessor
4. For Kentucky specifically: Trade-in must be previously registered in Kentucky (same restriction as purchases)

**How It Affects Tax:**
Because Kentucky taxes leases on a **monthly gross receipts basis**, reducing the capitalized cost through a trade-in lowers the monthly payment, which in turn lowers the monthly tax.

**Example - With Trade-In:**
```
Vehicle Cap Cost:                  $35,000
Trade-In Value:                    $ 8,000  ← Reduces cap cost
Adjusted Cap Cost:                 $27,000
Residual Value:                    $20,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Depreciation Amount:               $ 7,000
Monthly Payment (36 months):       $  194.44
Monthly Tax @ 6%:                  $   11.67
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Lease Tax (36 months):       $  420.00
(vs. $720 without trade-in)
```

**Payoff vs. Value:**
The trade-in **value** (what the dealer allows) is what reduces the cap cost. If you owe more than it's worth (negative equity), the payoff amount doesn't affect the tax calculation - only the actual value does.

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability (Leases)

**Treatment:** VSC is TAXABLE; GAP insurance is NOT taxable

**Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC):**
- ✅ **TAXABLE** at 6% (since July 1, 2018)
- Sales tax applies whether purchased with a lease or a purchase
- Tax is calculated on the VSC premium

**GAP Insurance:**
- ✅ **NOT TAXABLE** (classified as insurance)
- Exempt from sales tax in Kentucky
- Can be purchased with a lease without tax implications

**Other Backend Products:**
- Maintenance plans: **TAXABLE** (treated like extended warranties)
- Tire & wheel protection: **TAXABLE** (if structured as service contract)
- Prepaid maintenance: **TAXABLE** (optional maintenance contracts)
- Key replacement coverage: Depends on structure (insurance vs. service contract)

**Example:**
```
Monthly Lease Payment:          $  400.00
VSC (amortized monthly):        $   69.44  ← TAXABLE
GAP (amortized monthly):        $   24.86  ← NOT TAXABLE
─────────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Amount:                 $  469.44
Tax @ 6%:                       $   28.17
GAP (added separately):         $   24.86
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly Payment:          $  522.47
```

### 2.5 Documentation Fee Treatment on Leases

**Treatment:** TAXABLE (same as purchases)

Documentation fees on leases are subject to the 6% sales tax in Kentucky.

**Official Guidance:**
Documentation or processing fees constitute a service that is part of the sale/lease and are considered gross receipts pursuant to KRS 139.050.

**Lease-Specific Fees:**
- **Acquisition Fee:** Typically charged by lessor (captive finance) - **TAXABLE**
- **Doc Fee:** Charged by dealer for administrative processing - **TAXABLE**
- **Disposition Fee:** Charged at lease end for vehicle return - **TAXABLE** when collected

**Other Fees (NOT Taxable):**
- Title fees (paid to state)
- Registration fees (paid to state)
- License fees (paid to state)

**Example:**
```
Capitalized Cost:                  $35,000
Acquisition Fee:                   $   595  ← TAXABLE
Doc Fee:                           $   400  ← TAXABLE
─────────────────────────────────────────
Gross Cap Cost:                    $35,995
Residual:                          $20,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Monthly Payment (36 months):       $  444.31
Tax @ 6%:                          $   26.66
Total Monthly:                     $  470.97
```

**Source:** Kentucky Revenue Publication "Sales Tax Facts"; KRS 139.050

### 2.6 Lease Buyout Taxation

**Treatment:** 6% sales tax due on buyout price

When a lessee decides to purchase the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term, Kentucky requires:
- **6% sales tax** on the buy-out price (residual value)
- Transfer fees
- Registration fees

**Example:**
```
Original Lease:
  36-month term, $20,000 residual value

At Lease End:
  Buyout Price (Residual):       $20,000.00
  Sales Tax @ 6%:                $ 1,200.00
  Transfer Fee:                  $     9.00
  Registration:                  $    21.00
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Total to Purchase:             $21,230.00
```

**No Credit for Prior Tax Paid:**
The sales tax paid monthly during the lease term does NOT reduce the tax due on the buyout. This is a separate purchase transaction.

**Source:** Kentucky Department of Revenue guidance; industry sources

### 2.7 Out-of-State Leased Vehicles

**Treatment:** 6% usage tax due upon first registration in Kentucky

When registering an out-of-state leased vehicle in Kentucky for the first time:

**Tax Collection:**
A **6% usage tax** is collected by the County Clerk upon first time registration from out-of-state.

**Tax Credit:**
The leasing company receives **credit for all state sales tax currently paid to another state**. Any remaining difference must be paid at registration time in Kentucky.

**Example:**
```
Scenario 1: Lease originated in Ohio (5.75% tax)
  Kentucky Usage Tax:            6.00%
  Credit for Ohio Tax:          -5.75%
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Additional Tax Due:            0.25% (on calculated value)

Scenario 2: Lease originated in Illinois (7.25% tax)
  Kentucky Usage Tax:            6.00%
  Credit for Illinois Tax:      -7.25%
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Additional Tax Due:            $0.00 (IL rate exceeds KY)
```

## 3. RECIPROCITY & INTERSTATE TRANSACTIONS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid to Other States

**Policy:** Credit allowed, with Kentucky rate (6%) as minimum

Kentucky gives all registrants **credit for the amount of sales tax they paid to another state**.

**Official Guidance:**
> "If a person purchases tangible property from an out of state retailer for use in Kentucky and pays that seller the state sales tax, then the clerk will allow credit for the state sales tax properly paid, up to 6%, provided a sales receipt or invoice is produced to verify the tax paid."

**Key Points:**
- Maximum credit: **6%** (Kentucky's rate)
- **No credit is allowed for local sales taxes paid** to other states
- Must provide documentation (sales receipt or invoice)
- Credit applies to state-level taxes only

**How It Works:**

**Scenario 1: Other State Rate Lower**
```
Vehicle purchased in Tennessee (7% state tax)
Purchase Price:               $25,000
Tennessee Sales Tax (7%):     $ 1,750  ← Paid to Tennessee

Kentucky Usage Tax Due:
  $25,000 × 6%                $ 1,500
  Credit for TN Tax:          -$ 1,500  (capped at KY rate)
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Amount Due to Kentucky:     $     0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Rate Lower (Non-Zero)**
```
Vehicle purchased in Alabama (2% state tax)
Purchase Price:               $25,000
Alabama Sales Tax (2%):       $   500  ← Paid to Alabama

Kentucky Usage Tax Due:
  $25,000 × 6%                $ 1,500
  Credit for AL Tax:          -$   500
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Amount Due to Kentucky:     $ 1,000
```

**Scenario 3: No Sales Tax State**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana (no sales tax)
Purchase Price:               $25,000
Montana Sales Tax:            $     0  ← Paid to Montana

Kentucky Usage Tax Due:
  $25,000 × 6%                $ 1,500
  Credit for MT Tax:          -$     0
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Amount Due to Kentucky:     $ 1,500
```

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of sales tax payment to other state
- Bill of sale or purchase agreement showing tax paid
- Tax receipt from other state DMV/DOR
- Invoice clearly indicating state sales tax amount

**When Tax is Collected:**
Tax is paid to the County Clerk when the vehicle is registered/titled in Kentucky for the first time.

### 3.2 Special Reciprocity Rules

**Georgia Exclusion (Important):**
> "Tax credits will not be issued to vehicles purchased in Georgia after 3/1/2013."

Kentucky specifically EXCLUDES Georgia from the reciprocity credit system for vehicles purchased after March 1, 2013. This is due to Georgia's unique title ad valorem tax (TAVT) system, which replaced the traditional sales tax.

**Why Georgia is Different:**
- Georgia switched from sales tax to a one-time Title Ad Valorem Tax (TAVT) in March 2013
- TAVT is not considered equivalent to a traditional sales tax
- Kentucky does not recognize TAVT as a creditable "sales tax"

**Impact:**
If you purchase a vehicle in Georgia after 3/1/2013, you will owe the **full 6% Kentucky usage tax** with no credit for the Georgia TAVT paid.

**Nonresident Vehicle Purchases:**
Kentucky dealers selling to nonresidents typically must collect Kentucky sales tax unless:
1. Vehicle will be registered in another state AND
2. Immediately transported out of Kentucky AND
3. Proper documentation is provided (nonresident affidavit)

**Military Personnel:**
Active-duty military members stationed in Kentucky but maintaining legal residency in another state may be exempt from Kentucky motor vehicle usage tax if:
- Vehicle is registered in their home state
- Military orders establish non-Kentucky residency
- Proper military documentation is provided

**Source:** Kentucky County Clerk guidance (multiple counties); analysis of Georgia TAVT system

### 3.3 Moving to Kentucky (New Residents)

**Tax Liability:**
When moving to Kentucky from another state with a vehicle you already own:

**General Rule:**
If you purchased and titled the vehicle in another state while residing there, and you paid that state's sales tax, Kentucky typically does NOT impose additional usage tax when you register the vehicle in Kentucky.

**Requirements:**
- Vehicle must have been purchased and titled while you were a resident of the other state
- You must have paid the other state's sales tax
- Provide documentation of prior registration and tax payment

**Example:**
```
Situation: You lived in Ohio for 5 years, purchased a car in 2023, paid Ohio sales tax, then moved to Kentucky in 2025

Kentucky Usage Tax Due: $0 (already paid tax to Ohio while residing there)

Transfer/Registration Fees Still Apply:
  Title Transfer Fee:          $    9.00
  Registration Fee:            $   21.00
  County Clerk Fee:            $    5.00
```

## 4. UNIQUE KENTUCKY FEATURES

### 4.1 Usage Tax vs. Sales Tax Terminology

**Kentucky's Unique Terminology:**
Kentucky uses the term **"Motor Vehicle Usage Tax"** rather than "sales tax" for vehicles.

**Legal Basis:**
- **KRS 138.460:** Motor Vehicle Usage Tax statute
- **Tax imposed on:** "The use in Kentucky of every motor vehicle"
- **Rate:** 6% on retail price

**What This Means:**
The tax is technically imposed on the **use** of the vehicle in Kentucky, not the **sale** itself. However, in practice:
- It functions identically to a sales tax
- It's collected at the same time as the sale/registration
- The rate and calculation are the same as a sales tax

**Collection Points:**
- Collected by the **County Clerk** when the fee for titling or registering a motor vehicle the first time it is offered for titling or registration in Kentucky
- Upon the transfer of title or registration of any motor vehicle previously titled or registered in Kentucky

**Why "Usage Tax"?**
This terminology allows Kentucky to:
- Tax vehicles registered by Kentucky residents who purchased out-of-state
- Tax the "use" rather than just the "sale" transaction
- Capture tax on private party sales and gifts

**Source:** KRS 138.450, 138.460; Kentucky Department of Revenue

### 4.2 90% MSRP Minimum for New Vehicles

**Unique Rule:** Minimum tax basis for new vehicles

For **new vehicles**, Kentucky uses the greater of:
1. **Total consideration given** (cash/financed amount + trade-in value), OR
2. **90% of Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)**

**Why This Matters:**
This prevents tax avoidance through artificially low stated purchase prices or sweetheart deals.

**Example:**
```
Scenario 1: Normal Purchase
  MSRP:                          $40,000
  Actual Purchase Price:         $38,000
  Trade-In:                      $10,000
  Total Consideration:           $48,000
  90% of MSRP:                   $36,000
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Tax Base (greater of):         $48,000
  Tax @ 6%:                      $ 2,880

Scenario 2: Sweetheart Deal (Family Member)
  MSRP:                          $40,000
  Stated Purchase Price:         $20,000  (gift from family dealer)
  Trade-In:                      $     0
  Total Consideration:           $20,000
  90% of MSRP:                   $36,000  ← This is used
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Tax Base (greater of):         $36,000
  Tax @ 6%:                      $ 2,160
```

**Anti-Avoidance Purpose:**
If the Department of Revenue suspects that the purchase price was **artificially decreased**, they will calculate sales tax based on the car's fair market value by referring to:
- Kelley Blue Book (KBB)
- NADA values
- Other reliable valuation sources

**Used Vehicles:**
This 90% MSRP rule does **NOT** apply to used vehicles. Used vehicle tax is based on actual consideration or book value.

**Source:** Kentucky Revenue Policy; industry analysis; KRS 138.450 definitions

### 4.3 Average Trade-In Value for Used Vehicles

**Valuation Method:** Book value used if declared price is low

For **used vehicles**, if the clerk suspects an artificially low purchase price, they may use the **average trade-in value** from industry valuation guides.

**How It Works:**
1. Buyer declares purchase price on title application
2. If price seems unusually low, clerk looks up the vehicle in:
   - Kelley Blue Book
   - NADA Used Car Guide
   - Black Book
3. Clerk may use the **average trade-in value** as the tax basis

**Example:**
```
Private Party Sale:
  2018 Honda Accord EX
  Actual Sale Price (declared):  $ 8,000
  KBB Average Trade-In Value:    $13,500

County Clerk Assessment:
  Tax Base Used:                 $13,500  (book value)
  Tax @ 6%:                      $   810
  (instead of $480 on declared price)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents tax avoidance through artificially low stated prices
- Commonly applied in private party sales between family members
- Clerk has discretion to challenge any suspicious valuations

**Out-of-State Used Vehicle Purchases:**
For used vehicles purchased out-of-state by Kentucky residents:
- **No trade-in credit allowed** (originally)
- Average trade-in value from the book is included as part of the **Total Consideration Given**
- Recent guidance suggests out-of-state used vehicle purchases **now allow trade-in credit**

**Source:** Kentucky County Clerk guidance; Motor Vehicle Usage Tax FAQ; Revenue Policy 71P080

### 4.4 Lease to Ownership Transfers

**Treatment:** Special rules for converting lease to purchase

When a leased vehicle is converted to ownership during the lease term (not at lease end):

**Tax Implications:**
The lessee will be required to pay:
- **6% sales tax** on the **remaining balance** or buyout price
- Transfer fees
- Registration fees

**Example:**
```
Current Lease Status:
  24 months into 36-month lease
  Original residual value: $18,000
  Early buyout price: $22,000 (remaining payments + residual)

Tax Due:
  Buyout Price:                  $22,000.00
  Sales Tax @ 6%:                $ 1,320.00
  Title Transfer:                $     9.00
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Due:                     $23,329.00
```

**Note:** Tax already paid on monthly lease payments does NOT reduce the tax due on the buyout.

**Source:** Madison County Clerk "Lease to Ownership" guidance

### 4.5 HB 8 (2018) - Extended Warranty Services Taxation

**Major Tax Law Change:** July 1, 2018

Kentucky House Bill 366/487 (2018) significantly expanded Kentucky's sales tax base to include **35 new services**, including extended warranty services.

**What Changed:**
- **Before July 1, 2018:** Extended warranties were NOT taxable
- **After July 1, 2018:** Extended warranties ARE taxable at 6%

**Official Description:**
> "Extended warranty services means services provided through a service contract agreement between the contract provider and the purchaser where the purchaser agrees to pay compensation for the contract and the provider agrees to repair, replace, support, or maintain tangible personal property or digital property."

**Automotive Impact:**
- Vehicle Service Contracts (VSCs): **NOW TAXABLE**
- Extended warranties sold by automobile dealers: **NOW TAXABLE**
- The 6% sales tax applies to the contract price

**Grandfather Clause:**
Contracts sold **before July 1, 2018** remain **non-taxable** if:
- Not required as part of the sale
- Separately itemized on customer's invoice
- Separately tracked in retailer's books and records

**2022-2023 Further Expansions:**
Kentucky continued expanding the sales tax base:
- Extended warranties on **real property** (2023)
- Removed limitation that warranties must cover property already subject to sales tax

**Source:** Kentucky HB 366/487 (2018); Kentucky Sales Tax Facts (May 2018, Sept 2022); Blue & Co. tax analysis

### 4.6 Motor Vehicle Usage Tax vs. General Sales Tax

**Two Separate Tax Systems:**

Kentucky operates two parallel sales tax systems:

**1. Motor Vehicle Usage Tax (KRS 138.460)**
- Rate: 6%
- Applies to: Motor vehicles for use on public highways
- Collected by: County Clerks at registration
- Authority: Chapter 138 of Kentucky Revised Statutes

**2. General Sales and Use Tax (KRS 139)**
- Rate: 6%
- Applies to: Tangible personal property, digital property, and certain services
- Collected by: Retailers
- Authority: Chapter 139 of Kentucky Revised Statutes

**Why Two Systems?**
- Different collection mechanisms (clerks vs. retailers)
- Different exemptions apply
- Motor vehicles treated specially due to titling/registration requirements
- Historical development of Kentucky tax law

**Overlap Example:**
- **Vehicle purchase:** Subject to KRS 138.460 (Motor Vehicle Usage Tax)
- **Extended warranty:** Subject to KRS 139 (General Sales Tax)
- **Both at 6% rate, but different legal authorities**

**Source:** KRS Chapter 138 and 139; Kentucky Department of Revenue

---

## 5. EXEMPTIONS & SPECIAL CASES

### 5.1 Common Exemptions

Kentucky provides numerous exemptions from motor vehicle usage tax under **KRS 138.470**:

**Gift Exemptions:**
- Gifts between spouses
- Gifts between parents and children

**Source:** KRS 138.470; Kentucky Department of Revenue exemption guidance

### 5.2 Private Party Sales

**Tax Collection:**
Private party sales (individual to individual) are subject to the same **6% motor vehicle usage tax**.

**How It Works:**
1. Buyer and seller complete the transaction
2. **Buyer** is responsible for paying tax (not collected at sale)
3. Tax is paid to the County Clerk when registering/titling the vehicle

**Valuation Issues:**
If the County Clerk believes the stated purchase price is too low:
- Clerk may use **average trade-in value** from valuation guides
- Clerk has authority to assess tax on the higher value
- Common in family sales or sweetheart deals

**Trade-In Credit:**
Private party buyers do **NOT** receive trade-in credit. The trade-in credit only applies when trading to a licensed dealer.

**Example:**
```
Private Party Sale:
────────────────────────────────────
Agreed Purchase Price:     $15,000
(No trade-in credit available)

Tax Due at County Clerk:
  $15,000 × 6%             $   900.00
  Title Transfer Fee:      $     9.00
  Registration Fee:        $    21.00
  County Clerk Fee:        $     5.00
  ────────────────────────────────────
  Total Due:               $   935.00
```

Kentucky motor vehicle dealers must:
- Register for Kentucky sales tax account with the Department of Revenue
- Collect motor vehicle usage tax on retail sales
- Report and remit tax collected monthly
- Maintain records of all sales transactions

- **Form 51A135:** Kentucky Sales Tax Motor Vehicle Sales Supplementary Schedule
- Filed with each sales tax return for periods including motor vehicle sales

**Filing Frequency:**
- **Monthly** for most dealers
- Due on the **20th day** of the month following the reporting period

**Trade-In Documentation:**
Dealers must carefully document trade-ins to support the trade-in credit allowed:
- Trade-in vehicle must be previously registered in Kentucky
- Document VIN, year, make, model
- Document trade-in allowance amount
- Maintain appraisal records

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TAX-SVC

### 7.1 Calculation Logic

**For Retail Sales:**
```typescript
interface KYRetailTaxCalc {
  vehiclePrice: number;
  accessories: number;          // Taxable
  laborCharges: number;          // Taxable (prep, installation, etc.)
  docFee: number;                // TAXABLE in KY (unlike MN)
  tradeInValue: number;          // Credit ONLY if used vehicle & KY registered
  isTradeInKYRegistered: boolean; // Required for trade-in credit
  isVehicleNew: boolean;         // Affects trade-in eligibility
  manufacturerRebate: number;    // Reduces taxable price
  dealerIncentive: number;       // Reduces taxable price
  vscAmount: number;             // TAXABLE (since July 1, 2018)
  gapAmount: number;             // NOT taxable
  msrp: number;                  // For new vehicles: 90% MSRP minimum

  // Calculate trade-in credit eligibility
  let effectiveTradeIn = 0;
  if (!isVehicleNew && isTradeInKYRegistered) {
    effectiveTradeIn = tradeInValue; // Full credit for used vehicles
  }

  // Calculate taxable base
  let taxablePrice = vehiclePrice
    + accessories
    + laborCharges
    + docFee              // Kentucky includes doc fees
    + vscAmount           // Kentucky taxes VSCs since 2018
    - effectiveTradeIn
    - manufacturerRebate
    - dealerIncentive;

  // For new vehicles: 90% MSRP minimum rule
  if (isVehicleNew) {
    const msrpMinimum = msrp * 0.90;
    const totalConsideration = taxablePrice + effectiveTradeIn;
    if (totalConsideration < msrpMinimum) {
      taxablePrice = msrpMinimum - effectiveTradeIn;
    }
  }

  // State tax (no local sales tax in Kentucky)
  const stateTax = taxablePrice * 0.06;

  // GAP is added AFTER tax calculation (not taxable)
  const totalOutTheDoor = taxablePrice + stateTax + gapAmount;

  return {
    taxableBase: taxablePrice,
    stateTax: stateTax,
    totalTax: stateTax,
    totalAmount: totalOutTheDoor
  };
}
```

**For Leases:**
```typescript
interface KYLeaseTaxCalc {
  monthlyPayment: number;        // Base payment amount
  capCost: number;
  residualValue: number;
  tradeInValue: number;          // Reduces cap cost (if KY registered)
  isTradeInKYRegistered: boolean;
  cashDownPayment: number;       // Taxed upfront
  manufacturerRebate: number;    // Reduces cap cost
  accessoriesInstalled: number;  // Increases cap cost (taxable)
  acquisitionFee: number;        // TAXABLE in KY
  docFee: number;                // TAXABLE in KY
  vscMonthlyAmount: number;      // TAXABLE (amortized)
  gapMonthlyAmount: number;      // NOT taxable

  // Effective cap cost after trade-in
  let effectiveCapCost = capCost - manufacturerRebate;
  if (isTradeInKYRegistered) {
    effectiveCapCost -= tradeInValue;
  }
  effectiveCapCost += accessoriesInstalled + acquisitionFee + docFee;

  // Monthly tax calculation (Kentucky taxes on ongoing basis)
  const taxableMonthly = monthlyPayment + vscMonthlyAmount;
  const monthlyTax = taxableMonthly * 0.06;

  // Upfront tax on down payment
  const downPaymentTax = cashDownPayment * 0.06;

  return {
    monthlyPayment: monthlyPayment,
    monthlyTaxableAmount: taxableMonthly,
    monthlyTax: monthlyTax,
    monthlyGap: gapMonthlyAmount, // Added separately (not taxed)
    totalMonthly: taxableMonthly + monthlyTax + gapMonthlyAmount,
    downPayment: cashDownPayment,
    downPaymentTax: downPaymentTax
  };
}
```

### 7.2 Jurisdiction Detection

**Simple Implementation:**
Kentucky has NO local sales taxes. All transactions use the flat 6% state rate.

```typescript
function getKYSalesTaxRate(
  transactionType: 'purchase' | 'lease',
  county: string // Not used in KY, but kept for interface consistency
): number {
  const STATE_RATE = 0.06;

  // Kentucky has no local sales taxes
  // Same rate for purchases and leases
  return STATE_RATE;
}
```

**No Additional Fees:**
Unlike some states, Kentucky does NOT have:
- Local vehicle excise taxes
- Metro area transit taxes
- County-specific surcharges

The 6% rate is uniform statewide for all counties and cities.

### 7.3 Edge Cases

**1. Trade-In Eligibility Check:**
```typescript
function isTradeInEligible(
  vehicleType: 'new' | 'used',
  tradeInRegistrationState: string
): boolean {
  // New vehicles: NO trade-in credit in Kentucky
  if (vehicleType === 'new') {
    return false;
  }

  // Used vehicles: Must be Kentucky registered
  if (vehicleType === 'used' && tradeInRegistrationState === 'KY') {
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

**2. 90% MSRP Minimum for New Vehicles:**
```typescript
function calculateNewVehicleTaxBase(
  msrp: number,
  purchasePrice: number,
  rebates: number,
  tradeInValue: number // Always 0 for new vehicles in KY
): number {
  const netPrice = purchasePrice - rebates;
  const totalConsideration = netPrice + tradeInValue;
  const msrpMinimum = msrp * 0.90;

  // Use greater of total consideration or 90% MSRP
  const taxBase = Math.max(totalConsideration, msrpMinimum);

  return taxBase;
}
```

**3. VSC Taxation (Date-Dependent):**
```typescript
function isVSCTaxable(contractDate: Date): boolean {
  const taxableStartDate = new Date('2018-07-01');

  // Contracts on or after July 1, 2018 are taxable
  return contractDate >= taxableStartDate;
}
```

**4. Reciprocity Credit (Georgia Special Case):**
```typescript
function calculateReciprocityCredit(
  otherStateTaxPaid: number,
  otherStateTaxRate: number,
  purchaseState: string,
  purchaseDate: Date
): number {
  const KY_RATE = 0.06;

  // Georgia exclusion (after March 1, 2013)
  if (purchaseState === 'GA' && purchaseDate > new Date('2013-03-01')) {
    return 0; // No credit for Georgia TAVT
  }

  // Maximum credit is Kentucky's 6% rate
  const creditRate = Math.min(otherStateTaxRate, KY_RATE);

  return otherStateTaxPaid * (creditRate / otherStateTaxRate);
}
```

**5. Negative Equity (Conservative Approach):**
```typescript
// Kentucky does not explicitly address negative equity
// Conservative approach: Do NOT tax negative equity
function calculateTaxBaseWithNegativeEquity(
  vehiclePrice: number,
  tradeInValue: number,
  tradeInPayoff: number
): number {
  // Use actual trade-in value, not payoff amount
  // Negative equity (payoff - value) is NOT added to tax base
  const taxBase = vehiclePrice - tradeInValue;

  // Note: Negative equity is rolled into loan amount
  // but is NOT part of taxable consideration
  const negativeEquity = Math.max(0, tradeInPayoff - tradeInValue);
  // negativeEquity is NOT added to taxBase

  return taxBase;
}
```
