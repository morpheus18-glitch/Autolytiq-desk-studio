## Executive Summary

Illinois has one of the most complex and highest vehicle tax systems in the United States, particularly for leases in Chicago. The state uses a STATE_PLUS_LOCAL tax scheme with full trade-in credit on retail sales (since 2022) and monthly lease taxation (since 2015).

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Chicago residents pay an additional 8% Personal Property Lease Use Tax on top of the 9.5% sales tax rate, resulting in a **17.5% effective tax rate on lease payments** - one of the highest lease tax rates in the nation.

---

## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### Base Tax Rate
- **State rate:** 6.25%
- **Scheme:** STATE_PLUS_LOCAL (full jurisdiction stacking)

### Local Rates
| Jurisdiction | Total Rate | Breakdown |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Chicago** | **10.25%** | 6.25% state + 1.25% city + 1.75% Cook County + 1% RTA |
| **Suburban Cook County** | 8.25% | 6.25% state + 1.75% county + 0.25% varies |
| **Rest of State** | 6.25% - 8.75% | 6.25% state + varying local |
| **Highest (Harvey, Harwood Heights, Matteson)** | 11.5% | State + maximum local combinations |

Chicago has one of the highest combined vehicle sales tax rates in the United States.

---

## 2. TRADE-IN CREDIT

### Current Policy (Since January 1, 2022)
- **Policy:** FULL trade-in credit with NO CAP
- **Legal basis:** Public Act 102-0353 (effective Jan 1, 2022)
- **Prior rule:** $10,000 cap (eliminated in 2022)

### How It Works
- Trade-in value is fully deducted from purchase price before tax
- Applies to **dealer purchases only**
- Does **NOT** apply to private party vehicle use tax
- No limit on the amount of credit

**Example:**
```
Vehicle price:     $30,000
Trade-in value:   -$10,000
Taxable base:      $20,000
Tax (6.25%):       $1,250
```

### IMPORTANT: Trade-In on Leases
**NO TAX BENEFIT** on leases since January 1, 2015. Trade-ins still reduce capitalized cost, but since tax is charged on monthly payments (not cap cost), there is no sales tax credit benefit.

---

## 3. MANUFACTURER & DEALER REBATES

### Manufacturer Rebates
- **Tax treatment:** NOT TAXABLE
- **Effect:** Reduce the sale price before tax calculation
- **Legal basis:** 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.2125

### Dealer Rebates
- **Tax treatment:** TAXABLE
- **Effect:** Do NOT reduce the taxable sale price
- **Legal basis:** 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.2125

**Exception:** Dealer incentives or bonuses contingent on meeting manufacturer marketing standards, facility standards, or satisfaction goals are NOT part of taxable gross receipts.

---

## 4. DOCUMENTATION FEE

### 2025 Cap
- **Maximum allowed:** $367.70 (effective January 1, 2025)
- **Prior year (2024):** $358.03
- **Change:** +2.7% (indexed to CPI-U)
- **Legal basis:** 815 ILCS 375/11.1

### Tax Treatment
- **Taxable:** YES - included in gross receipts
- **Legal basis:** Illinois Supreme Court ruling; 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.2075

### Key Points
- Doc fee cap is adjusted annually based on Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
- Receipts collected as document fees are subject to tax and must be included on ST-556 and ST-556-LSE tax returns
- Average doc fee in Illinois is $160, but dealers can charge up to the legal maximum

---

## 5. SERVICE CONTRACTS & GAP INSURANCE

### Retail Sales
| Product | Taxable? | Condition |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Service Contracts (VSC) | **YES** | If bundled with vehicle sale |
| Service Contracts (VSC) | **NO** | If sold separately and separately stated |
| GAP Insurance | **YES** | If bundled with vehicle sale |
| GAP Insurance | **NO** | If sold separately and separately stated |

### Lease Sales
| Product | Taxable? | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Service Contracts | **NO** | When capitalized into lease and separately stated |
| GAP Insurance | **NO** | When capitalized into lease and separately stated |

**Legal basis:** Illinois Department of Revenue guidance states charges for maintenance agreements or warranty contracts are taxable if included in selling price but NOT taxable if sold separately.

---

## 6. ACCESSORIES

- **Tax treatment:** TAXABLE
- **Included in:** Taxable selling price
- **Legal basis:** 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.2075

Accessories, freight, labor, dealer preparation, and any costs passed to the customer are included in the taxable gross receipts.

---

## 7. NEGATIVE EQUITY

### Tax Treatment
- **Taxable:** NO (when rolled into new loan)
- **Legal basis:** Illinois automobile dealer sales tax guidance

### Key Distinction
| Scenario | Taxable? |
|----------|----------|
| **Cash outs of trades** | YES - Taxable |
| **Bank payoffs rolled into new loans** | NO - Not considered cash outs |
| **Negative equity rolled into loan** | NO - Not taxable |

**Per Illinois dealer guidance:** "Car loan payoffs that are rolled into the new car loan are not considered cash outs."

---

## 8. LEASE TAXATION

### Lease Method
- **Method:** MONTHLY (tax on each payment)
- **Effective date:** January 1, 2015
- **Legal basis:** ST-9-LSE Guide for Reporting Sales on Leased Vehicles

### 2015 Law Change (Critical)
**BEFORE Jan 1, 2015:**
- Tax was charged on the **entire capitalized cost** upfront
- Trade-ins reduced the taxable base (tax benefit)

**AFTER Jan 1, 2015:**
- Tax is charged on **down payment + monthly lease payments only**
- Trade-ins reduce cap cost but provide NO tax benefit
- Significant tax savings for lessees

### Taxable Components on Leases
- Down payment (if any)
- Monthly lease payments
- Doc fee (taxed upfront)

### NOT Taxable on Leases
- Service contracts (if separately stated and capitalized)
- GAP insurance (if separately stated and capitalized)
- Title fees
- Registration fees

## 9. CHICAGO & COOK COUNTY SPECIAL RULES

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Chicago Lease Use Tax

**Chicago residents** who lease vehicles are subject to:
1. **Sales tax:** 9.5% (6.25% state + 1.25% city + 1.75% Cook + 0.5% varies)
2. **PLUS: Personal Property Lease Use Tax:** 8%
3. **TOTAL EFFECTIVE RATE:** **17.5%**

This is applied to **lease payments only**, not retail purchases.

### Who Pays the Chicago Lease Use Tax?
- **Based on:** Buyer's **residence**, NOT dealer location
- **Applies to:** Chicago **residents** only
- **Legal basis:** Chicago Municipal Code Chapter 3-32

### Rate Comparison
| Location | Retail Tax | Lease Sales Tax | Lease Use Tax | Total Lease Tax |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Chicago Resident** | 10.25% | 9.5% | +8% | **17.5%** |
| **Suburban Cook County** | 8.25% | 8.25% | 0% | 8.25% |
| **Rest of Illinois** | 6.25%-8.75% | Same | 0% | Same |

### Example Calculation (Chicago Resident Lease)
```
Monthly payment:           $300
Sales tax (9.5%):          $28.50
Use tax (8%):              $24.00
Total monthly tax:         $52.50
Tax on payment:            17.5%
Total payment:             $352.50

Over 36 months:
Total tax paid: $1,890 (vs. $1,026 for suburban Cook County resident)
```

This makes leasing in Chicago one of the **most expensive tax environments for leases in the United States**.

---

## 10. RECIPROCITY (CREDIT FOR TAX PAID IN OTHER STATES)

### Policy
- **Enabled:** YES (limited)
- **Scope:** BOTH retail and lease
- **Mode:** CREDIT_UP_TO_STATE_RATE

### Requirements
1. **Proof required:** YES - must show separately stated tax on invoice
2. **Dealer purchases only:** Credit ONLY for dealer purchases, NOT private party
3. **Cap:** Credit capped at Illinois tax rate
4. **Forms:** RUT-25 (dealer purchases), RUT-50 (private party)

### How It Works

**Example 1: Dealer Purchase from Indiana**
```
Vehicle purchased from IN dealer with 7% tax paid
IL rate: 6.25% (before local)
Result: Customer gets credit up to IL rate
        May owe additional local tax
```

**Example 2: Private Party Purchase (NO CREDIT)**
```
Vehicle purchased from private party in WI with tax paid
IL rate: 6.25%
Result: Customer owes FULL IL tax (no credit for private party purchases)
```

### UNIQUE RESTRICTION
Illinois is one of the few states that **distinguishes between dealer and private party purchases** for reciprocity purposes. Most states provide reciprocity credit regardless of seller type.

### Non-Reciprocal States
According to Illinois Department of Revenue ST-58 chart, the following states do NOT provide reciprocal tax exemptions for Illinois residents:
- Arizona
- California
- Florida
- Hawaii
- Indiana
- Massachusetts
- Michigan
- South Carolina

---

## 11. SPECIAL STATE RULES

### Vehicle Class Differences
- **Standard:** All vehicle classes taxed the same
- **No special rates** for trucks, RVs, or motorcycles

### Assessment vs. Sale Price
- **Tax base:** Actual sale price (not assessed value)
- **Illinois does NOT use** assessed value like Georgia (TAVT) or West Virginia

### Title & Registration Fees
- **Title fee:** NOT taxable (government fee)
- **Registration fee:** NOT taxable (government fee)
- **Lien fee:** NOT taxable (government fee)

---

## 12. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Special Scheme: IL_CHICAGO_COOK

The `leaseRules.specialScheme` is set to `"IL_CHICAGO_COOK"` to handle:

1. **Chicago resident detection:** Must determine if buyer is Chicago resident
2. **Dual tax application:** Sales tax + use tax on lease payments
3. **Rate calculation:** Different sales tax rates for Chicago vs. suburban Cook vs. rest of state

### Required Logic for Implementation
```typescript
if (dealType === "LEASE") {
  if (buyerResidenceCity === "Chicago" && buyerResidenceState === "IL") {
    // Apply 9.5% sales tax + 8% use tax = 17.5% effective
    salesTaxRate = 0.095;
    useTaxRate = 0.08;
    totalTaxRate = 0.175;
  } else if (buyerCounty === "Cook" && buyerState === "IL") {
    // Apply 8.25% sales tax (typical suburban Cook)
    salesTaxRate = 0.0825;
    useTaxRate = 0;
  } else {
    // Apply standard IL rates
    salesTaxRate = calculateLocalRate(buyerZip);
    useTaxRate = 0;
  }
}
```
