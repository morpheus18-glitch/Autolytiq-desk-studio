# NextGen Automotive Desking Platform

## Overview

The NextGen Automotive Desking Platform is a **mobile-first** desking tool for automotive dealerships, designed for **value and velocity**. Built for salespeople on the lot and desk managers closing deals fast, the platform enables payment quotes in 30-45 seconds and complete deal structuring in 3-5 minutes. Core philosophy: profit is made when you acquire the car and prep it right - the desking tool focuses on speed, simplicity, and getting customers approved and into cars FAST.

## Product Vision: Two Modes

**MODE 1: Quick Quote** (30-45 seconds)
- Salesperson on lot, qualifying customer
- Phone-based wizard: Pick vehicle → Budget → Down → Trade → Payment
- Text quote to customer
- "Take to Desk" for full structuring

**MODE 2: Full Desk** (3-5 minutes)
- Complete deal structuring
- Start from Quick Quote OR blank desk
- Add F&I products
- Submit to finance

## Recent Changes (November 2024)

**Professional-Grade Polish** - Apple/Nike quality UI/UX enhancements (✅ COMPLETE):

- ✅ **Premium Skeleton Loading**: 6 reusable glassmorphic skeleton components (SkeletonCard, SkeletonForm, SkeletonPayment, SkeletonAccordion, SkeletonMetricGrid, SkeletonFullWorksheet) replace all spinner-based loading with layout-faithful placeholders; integrated into deals list, deal worksheet, scenarios with smooth 200ms transitions
- ✅ **Optimistic UI Mutations**: Factory utilities (createOptimisticCreate, createOptimisticDelete, setOptimisticState) provide instant feedback for scenario create/delete with automatic rollback on failure; visual affordances via pulse animation on optimistic items
- ✅ **Enhanced Toast System**: Rich notifications with 5 variants (success, info, warning, destructive, default); automatic icon rendering (CheckCircle, Info, AlertTriangle, AlertCircle); glassmorphism styling with backdrop-blur-xl; scale-in micro-interaction; action builders (createUndoAction, createViewAction, createRetryAction) for undo/retry functionality; rich toast helpers (showSuccessToast, showErrorToast, showInfoToast, showWarningToast) with smart durations (4s success, 8s errors); working undo for scenario deletion with snapshot capture pattern
- ✅ **Reusable Empty States**: EmptyState component with glassmorphic styling, fluid typography (text-step-0 to text-step-1), comprehensive test IDs, contextual iconography; integrated into deals list, trade garage, F&I products grid with actionable copy
- ✅ **Micro-interactions System**: 6 CSS animations (shake-error, success-glow, fade-in, scale-in, checkmark-draw, focus-glow) with 250-400ms timing cadence; state-guard pattern in auto-save indicator prevents reflow jitter; semantic styling (variant="outline" + green icon) for success states; reduced-motion compliance
- ✅ **Animation Quality Standards**: All animations use useRef + useState guards (not key-based remounts) to trigger on state change only; timing follows 200ms (smooth), 250ms (spring/scale), 300ms (shake/fade), 400ms (glow) cadence; semantic theme tokens (hsl(var(--ring))) instead of hardcoded colors; accessibility-first with prefers-reduced-motion support

**Quick Quote Wizard - Phase 1** (✅ COMPLETE):

- ✅ **6-Step Mobile Wizard**: Vehicle Selection → Budget → Down Payment → Trade-In → Result screen with clean, mobile-first navigation
- ✅ **Vehicle Inventory Integration**: Quick Quote fetches from `/api/inventory/search` endpoint with real-time search filtering across make, model, year, VIN
- ✅ **Mobile-Optimized Input Components**: MoneyInput with numeric keyboard, SuggestedAmounts with 56px touch targets ($1K, $2.5K, $5K, $10K quick-tap buttons)
- ✅ **Smart Payment Calculation**: Automatic recalculation using Decimal.js (precision: 20) whenever dependencies change (vehicle price, down payment, trade equity, APR, term)
- ✅ **Auto-Save Architecture**: POST creates quote on first calculation, PATCH updates database whenever user modifies inputs (back navigation tested and verified)
- ✅ **Text Quote Dialog**: Customer name/phone capture with Zod validation (min 2 chars name, min 10 digits phone), SMS endpoint ready for Twilio integration
- ✅ **Quote Contact Persistence**: quick_quote_contacts table stores all text quote attempts with status tracking (pending/sent/failed)
- ✅ **"Take to Desk" Conversion**: Seamless upgrade from Quick Quote to Full Desk - creates Deal + Customer + Scenario with all quote data, marks quote as 'converted', navigates to deal worksheet
- ✅ **Zustand State Management**: Complete wizard state persisted to localStorage, survives page refreshes, resets on new quote
- ✅ **Database Schema**: quick_quotes table (id, vehicle_id, quote_payload JSONB, status, timestamps) for full audit trail
- ✅ **End-to-End Validation**: Playwright tests confirm complete flow from vehicle selection through auto-save, recalculation, text quote, and conversion with database verification

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Auto-save recalculation: ResultStep watches [vehicle, downPayment, tradeValue, tradePayoff, apr, termMonths] and automatically persists updates
- FK handling: Conversion uses salesperson from quote or falls back to first user, returns 400 if no users exist (no more temp-user-id violations)
- Schema validation: PATCH endpoint validates using `insertQuickQuoteSchema.pick({ quotePayload: true })` for type safety
- Real-world workflow: User can go back, change down payment from $5K → $10K, payment recalculates, PATCH persists update, conversion creates deal with updated $10K value

**Remaining Work**:
- 📱 Mobile-optimize existing Full Desk tabs for thumb zone operation
- 🏠 Add Home Screen with Quick Quote + Full Desk entry points
- 📊 Update APR rate system to real-world credit tiers (8.9% - 23.9%)
- 💬 Complete Twilio integration for actual SMS delivery

## User Preferences

**Core Philosophy**: Value and velocity, not profit obsession
- "You make profit when you acquire the car and get it through recon properly"
- Desk managers need SPEED to close deals, not complex analytics
- Simple, fast, easy to understand
- Mobile-first (phone in pocket, not tablet or desktop)
- One-handed operation on the lot

**Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language
