## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 Tax Rates (Current 2025)

#### State Rate
- **Automotive Rate:** 2.0% (Alabama Code Section 40-23-2(4))
- **General Rate:** 4.0% (for comparison)
- **Applies to:** New and used automotive vehicles, truck trailers, semi-trailers, house trailers, and mobile homes

#### Local Rates
**Structure:** State + County + Municipal
- **County Rates:** Range from 0.50% to 6.75%
- **Municipal Rates:** Range from 0.00% to 2.00%
- **Total Combined Rates:** Typically 2.0% to 11.0%

**Examples by Major Jurisdiction:**
| Location | State | Local | Total | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Birmingham (Jefferson County) | 2.0% | 2.0% city + 2.0% county | 6.0% | High-tax area |
| Mobile | 2.0% | 5.0% city | 10.0% | One of highest in state |
| Baldwin County (Foley) | 2.0% | 0.5% | 2.5% | Lower local rates |
| Blount County | 2.0% | 0.5% | 2.5% | Rural county rate |
| State Average | 2.0% | ~3.4% avg | ~5.4% | Average combined |

**Important:** Dealers must collect sales taxes for the state, city, AND county where the dealership is located.

**Official Rate Resources:**
- Alabama Department of Revenue: https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/sales-use/tax-rates/
- 366 local tax jurisdictions across Alabama
- Rates updated regularly; verify current rates before transactions

### 1.2 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** **PARTIAL** - Trade-in credit applies to STATE tax only, NOT local taxes

#### How It Works
1. Trade-in value is deducted from vehicle purchase price
2. Sales tax calculated on **net difference** (purchase price minus trade-in)
3. Credit applies ONLY to the 2% state portion
4. Local county and city taxes still apply to full purchase price

**Example Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:        $30,000
Trade-In Value:               -$10,000
Net Taxable Amount:            $20,000

State Tax (2% on net):         $400     (2% of $20,000)
Local Tax (4% on gross):       $1,200   (4% of $30,000 - NO trade-in credit)
Total Tax Due:                 $1,600
```

**Legal Basis:**
- Alabama Code Section 40-23-2(4): "When any used automotive vehicle or truck trailer is taken in trade as a credit or part payment on the sale of a new or used vehicle, the tax is paid on the net difference"
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

**Critical Note:** This is a common point of confusion. The trade-in credit does NOT apply to local taxes, which can represent 50-75% of the total tax burden in high-tax jurisdictions.

### 1.3 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** **TAXABLE** - Manufacturer rebates do NOT reduce taxable sales price

#### Tax Treatment
- Rebates are applied AFTER tax calculation
- Buyer pays sales tax on full vehicle price before rebates
- No tax reduction for manufacturer incentives, cash-back offers, or rebates

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $25,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$2,000
Customer Pays:                 $23,000

Tax Base:                      $25,000  (full price, NOT $23,000)
Sales Tax (2% state):          $500
```

**Lease Treatment:**
For leases, capitalized cost reductions or down payments by the customer whether by cash, manufacturer rebate, or other means are subject to lease tax. This includes federal government rebates for electric vehicles - these are considered part of the lease payment and are taxable.

**Contrast with Trade-Ins:**
Unlike trade-ins (which DO reduce the taxable base for state tax), manufacturer rebates provide no tax benefit to the buyer.

### 1.4 Dealer Rebate Treatment

**Policy:** Dealer incentives are generally treated similarly to manufacturer rebates

Dealer incentives/rebates paid by manufacturer to dealer (not customer) do not affect the customer's tax calculation. The customer's taxable amount is based on the agreed purchase price.

If a dealer reduces the price due to their own promotion or discount, the tax is calculated on the actual reduced selling price.

### 1.5 Documentation Fee (Doc Fee) Taxability and Cap

#### Taxability
**TAXABLE** - Documentation fees are subject to automotive sales tax

"Dealer fees (also known as clerical fees, doc fees, dealer prep charge, processing fees, etc.) are taxable at the automotive rate."
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

#### Cap Amount
**NO CAP** - Alabama does not impose a statutory limit on dealer documentation fees

- **Average Doc Fee:** $485 (as of 2023 data)
- **Observed Range:** $300 to $600+
- Dealers may set their own documentation fees
- Some dealerships charge $595 or more

**Recommendation:** Buyers should inquire about doc fees upfront and negotiate if possible, as these fees can vary significantly between dealerships.

**Comparison:** Alabama is among the states with the highest average doc fees due to lack of regulation.

### 1.6 Title Fee Treatment

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE** when separately stated

"If clearly labeled and separately stated, the title fee is not subject to sales tax."
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

**Current Title Fee:** $25.00 (increased from $16.50 in earlier years)

**Important:** The title fee must be:
1. Clearly labeled as "Title Fee" on the invoice
2. Separately stated from other charges
3. Not bundled with taxable dealer fees

If bundled with other fees or not clearly separated, it may be considered part of the taxable transaction.

### 1.7 Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Policy:** Service contracts are **NOT TAXABLE**, but parts used are taxable under certain conditions

#### Extended Warranty / Service Contract Sales
Service contracts (extended warranties, vehicle service contracts) sold with vehicles are NOT subject to Alabama sales tax.

**Legal Basis:**
- Alabama Administrative Rule 810-6-1-.186.05: "Warranty, Extended or Service Contract"
- Services are generally not subject to Alabama sales tax

#### Parts Used Under Warranty
Tax is not due on the purchase of or withdrawal from inventory of parts which are used in performing services free of charge for a customer under the terms of a manufacturer's extended service contract sold to the customer by the dealer.

**Related Products:**
- **Key Replacement Programs:** Taxed similar to service contracts - the contract is not taxable, but parts used for repairs may be taxable depending on circumstances
- **Tire and Wheel/Dent and Ding/Road Hazard:** Same treatment as service contracts - contract not taxable, but parts used to perform repairs are taxable

### 1.8 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Policy:** **NOT TAXABLE**

"Debt Waiver/GAP Insurance: These items are not subject to sales tax."
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

GAP (Guaranteed Asset Protection) insurance is treated as an insurance product and is exempt from Alabama sales tax when sold in connection with automotive vehicle purchases or leases.

### 1.9 Accessories Taxability

**Policy:** Tax rate depends on WHEN accessories are purchased

#### Accessories Purchased WITH Vehicle
**Taxable at AUTOMOTIVE RATE (2% state + local)**

"The reduced automotive rate of sales or use tax applies to parts, attachments, or accessories purchased from the dealer as a unit along with the automotive vehicle."

- Accessories included in the vehicle sale contract are taxed at the reduced 2% state automotive rate
- Includes: aftermarket wheels, running boards, lift kits, audio systems, remote starters, etc.

#### Accessories Purchased AFTER Sale
**Taxable at GENERAL RATE (4% state + local)**

"Parts, attachments, or accessories purchased from the dealer after title and possession has passed to the purchaser are taxed at the regular rate."

- Once title and possession have transferred to the buyer, subsequent accessory purchases are taxed at the general 4% state rate (plus local taxes)
- This represents a significant increase from the 2% automotive rate

**Example:**
```
Scenario 1 - Accessories in Original Sale:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Accessories (wheels, audio):   +$3,000
Total Sale Price:              $33,000
Tax (2% state + 3% local):     $1,650

Scenario 2 - Accessories Purchased Next Day:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Tax (2% state + 3% local):     $1,500
Accessories (separate sale):   $3,000
Tax (4% state + 3% local):     $210

Total Scenario 2:              $31,710 (vs. $31,650 if purchased together)
```

**Strategic Consideration:** Buyers save on sales tax by purchasing accessories as part of the original vehicle sale rather than as a separate transaction after delivery.

#### Specific Add-Ons and Fees
- **Window Etching:** Service, not subject to sales tax
- **Shop Supply Fees:** Taxable when included on invoice with retail sale
- **Dealer Prep Charges:** Taxable at automotive rate

### 1.10 Negative Equity Taxability

**Policy:** Treatment differs between SALES and LEASES

#### For Vehicle PURCHASES (Sales)
**NOT TAXABLE** - Negative equity rolled into loan does not increase taxable amount

- Negative equity becomes part of the financed amount
- Sales tax is calculated on the vehicle purchase price only
- Negative equity added to loan principal is NOT included in tax base

**Example:**
```
New Vehicle Price:             $25,000
Trade-In Value:                $15,000
Trade-In Payoff:               -$18,000
Negative Equity:               -$3,000

Tax Base:                      $10,000  (net: $25,000 - $15,000)
Sales Tax (2% state):          $200

Amount Financed:               $13,200  ($10,000 net + $200 tax + $3,000 negative equity)
```

The $3,000 negative equity is added to the loan but does NOT affect the sales tax calculation.

#### For Vehicle LEASES
**TAXABLE** - Negative equity added to lease is subject to lease tax

"If the trade-in allowed has negative equity and that amount is added back to the price of the vehicle to be leased, the negative equity amount is subject to lease tax."
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

**Example:**
```
Lease Capitalized Cost:        $30,000
Negative Equity Added:         +$3,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $33,000

Lease Tax Due on Cap Reduction: Tax applies to the $3,000 negative equity
```

This is a significant difference from purchase transactions and should be clearly explained to customers considering leases with negative equity.

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** **MONTHLY PAYMENT TAXATION** with upfront tax on cap cost reductions

Alabama uses a hybrid approach:
1. **Monthly lease payments** are taxed as they are made
2. **Cap cost reductions** (down payments, trade-ins, rebates) are taxed upfront at lease inception
3. Tax applies to each payment, not the total amount upfront

**Legal Framework:**
"Rental tax is a privilege tax levied on the lessor for the leasing or renting of tangible personal property. This tax is due on 'true leases' in which the title to the property is retained by the lessor at the end of the lease agreement."
- Alabama Department of Revenue

### 2.2 Lease Tax Rates

#### State Rate
**1.5%** state lease/rental tax on automotive vehicles
- Alabama applies 1.5% (1 1/2 percent) to gross proceeds from leasing or rental of automotive vehicles
- This is lower than the general 4.0% rental tax on other tangible personal property

#### Local Rates
**County and municipal lease taxes apply** in addition to state rate
- Local lease tax rates vary by jurisdiction
- Must collect lease tax for state, city, and county where dealership is located
- Rates available at: https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/sales-use/tax-rates/

**Tax Liability:**
- Lease tax is levied against the **lessor** (leasing company)
- However, the tax may be (and typically is) passed on to the **lessee** (customer)
- Tax passed on to customer must be included in monthly taxable gross proceeds subject to lease tax

### 2.3 Cap Cost Reduction Taxability

**Policy:** Cap cost reductions are **FULLY TAXABLE** at lease inception

"Capitalized cost reductions or down payments by the customer whether by cash, manufacturer rebate, or other means are subject to lease tax."
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

#### What is Taxable
ALL of the following cap cost reductions are subject to lease tax:
- Cash down payments
- Manufacturer rebates applied as cap reduction
- Federal EV rebates ($7,500) applied as cap reduction
- Trade-in equity
- Dealer discounts applied as cap reduction

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                  $40,000
Cap Cost Reduction (cash):     $5,000
Cap Cost Reduction (rebate):   $2,500
Total Cap Cost Reduction:      $7,500

Lease Tax Due at Inception:
State (1.5%):                  $112.50
Local (assume 2%):             $150.00
Total Tax on Cap Reduction:    $262.50

Adjusted Capitalized Cost:     $32,500
Monthly Payment:               $450
Monthly Lease Tax:
State (1.5%):                  $6.75
Local (2%):                    $9.00
Total Monthly Tax:             $15.75
```

### 2.4 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Policy:** **NO TRADE-IN CREDIT** - Trade-ins do NOT reduce tax on leases

"The lease tax law does not allow a deduction for trade-ins, as in the sales tax law."
- Alabama Department of Revenue Automotive Sales, Use & Lease Tax Guide

#### Treatment of Trade-Ins on Leases

**If Trade-In Has Positive Equity:**
"If the customer trades in a vehicle that he owns and applies his equity in the vehicle as all or part of a cap cost reduction on the new leased vehicle, that amount is subject to lease tax."

The trade-in equity is treated as a cap cost reduction and is FULLY TAXABLE.

**If Trade-In Has Negative Equity:**
"If the trade-in allowed has negative equity and that amount is added back to the price of the vehicle to be leased, the negative equity amount is subject to lease tax."

The negative equity increases the capitalized cost and is TAXABLE.

**Critical Difference from Sales:**
This is a major disadvantage of leasing vs. purchasing in Alabama:
- **Purchase:** Trade-in reduces taxable amount (at least for state tax)
- **Lease:** Trade-in provides NO tax benefit; equity is taxed as cap cost reduction

**Example Comparison:**
```
PURCHASE SCENARIO:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000
Net Taxable (state):           $20,000
State Tax Savings:             $200

LEASE SCENARIO:
Cap Cost:                      $30,000
Trade-In Equity:               $10,000
Cap Reduction (taxable):       $10,000
Lease Tax on Trade-In:         $150 (at 1.5% state rate)
Tax Savings:                   $0 (actually COSTS $150 in tax)
```

### 2.5 Backend Product Taxability on Leases

**Policy:** Backend products on leases follow same rules as sales

#### Service Contracts (VSC)
**NOT TAXABLE**
- Extended warranties and service contracts are not subject to lease tax
- Same treatment as sales transactions

#### GAP Insurance
**NOT TAXABLE**
- GAP insurance is exempt from lease tax
- Treated as insurance product, not taxable tangible property

#### Accessories
**TAXABLE** at lease rates
- Accessories included in lease agreement are subject to lease tax
- Tax applies to portion of monthly payment attributable to accessories

### 2.6 Documentation Fee Treatment on Leases

**Policy:** Doc fees are **TAXABLE** on lease transactions

Dealer documentation fees, processing fees, and similar charges are subject to lease tax when included in lease transactions.

**Application:**
- If doc fee is paid upfront (at lease inception), it is taxed at the lease tax rate
- If capitalized into the lease, it becomes part of the monthly payment and is taxed monthly

---

## 3. RECIPROCITY AND TAX CREDITS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid in Other States

**Policy:** Alabama provides **FULL RECIPROCAL CREDIT** for taxes paid to other states

"Alabama is a reciprocal state and will acknowledge sales taxes paid to any state, as indicated on taxpayer bills of sale, invoices, etc."
- Alabama Department of Revenue

#### Legal Framework
Alabama Code Section 40-23-65: "Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by him with respect to the same property to another state and any subdivision thereof."

#### How Credits Work

**Scenario 1: Other State Tax ≥ Alabama Tax**
If sales/use tax paid to another state equals or exceeds Alabama's tax, NO additional Alabama use tax is due.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Georgia:   $30,000
Georgia tax paid (7%):          $2,100
Alabama tax would be (3%):      $900
Credit allowed:                 $900
Additional AL tax due:          $0
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Tax < Alabama Tax**
If tax paid to another state is less than Alabama's tax, pay the DIFFERENCE.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana:   $30,000
Montana tax paid (0%):          $0
Alabama tax due (3%):           $900
Credit allowed:                 $0
Additional AL tax due:          $900
```

### 3.2 Special Rules and Limitations

#### Credit Regardless of Other State's Policy
**Unique Feature:** "Credit for legally imposed sales and use taxes paid to any other state or its subdivisions will be allowed against Alabama use tax due even if that state does not allow credit for sales and use taxes paid to Alabama or its subdivisions."

Alabama provides credits unilaterally - you receive credit even if the other state wouldn't reciprocate.

#### Credit Cap
"The total credit allowed cannot exceed the taxes due the state of Alabama or its subdivisions, and if the legally imposed taxes paid to another state or its subdivisions exceed the taxes due Alabama and its subdivisions, no further credit shall be allowed."

**Translation:** You get credit up to Alabama's tax amount, but you don't get a refund if you paid more in another state.

#### Documentation Required
Taxpayers must provide documentation:
- Bill of sale showing vehicle price
- Receipt or invoice showing taxes paid to other state
- Proof of legal imposition of tax (not voluntary payment)

### 3.3 Alabama Drive-Out Provision

**Policy:** Special reduced tax rate for vehicles titled/registered out-of-state

**Effective Date:** July 1, 2022

**Rule:** Sales of vehicles exported or removed from Alabama within 72 hours by the purchaser for first use outside Alabama are subject to:
- Alabama sales tax at state automotive rate (2%) ONLY
- NO local county or municipal taxes

**Tax Cap:** "The amount of Alabama sales tax due on a motor vehicle registered or titled for use in another state will not exceed the amount of sales tax that would have been due in the state where the vehicle will be registered or titled for first use."

#### Requirements for Drive-Out Provision
1. Vehicle must be removed from Alabama within **72 hours** of purchase
2. Vehicle must be registered or titled in another state
3. First use must be outside Alabama
4. Dealer must collect 2% Alabama state tax (unless buyer's state has lower rate)

#### Example Applications

**Example 1 - Out-of-State Buyer (High Tax State):**
```
Georgia buyer purchases in Alabama:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Georgia tax rate:              7%
Alabama state tax:             2% = $600
Alabama local tax:             EXEMPT (drive-out)
Tax due to Alabama:            $600

Upon GA registration:
Georgia tax due:               7% = $2,100
Credit for AL tax:             -$600
Additional GA tax:             $1,500
```

**Example 2 - Out-of-State Buyer (Low Tax State):**
```
Montana buyer purchases in Alabama:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Montana tax rate:              0%
Alabama state tax:             Capped at 0% (Montana rate)
Alabama local tax:             EXEMPT (drive-out)
Tax due to Alabama:            $0
```

**Example 3 - Buyer Keeps in Alabama:**
```
Alabama resident purchases:
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Alabama state tax:             2% = $600
Local tax (assume 3%):         3% = $900
Total tax due:                 $1,500

Drive-out provision:           Does NOT apply (vehicle stays in AL)
```

#### Strategic Implications
- Out-of-state buyers can save significantly on local taxes
- Alabama dealers can compete more effectively with dealers in buyer's home state
- Buyers must comply with 72-hour removal requirement
- Documentation of out-of-state registration required

## 4. UNIQUE STATE FEATURES

### 4.1 Dual Automotive Tax Rates

**Feature:** Alabama has TWO different state tax rates for automotive transactions

1. **Sales Tax Rate:** 2% state (Code Section 40-23-2(4))
2. **Lease Tax Rate:** 1.5% state (Rental/Leasing Tax)

**Why Unique:** Most states use the same rate for sales and leases, or tax leases as sales. Alabama's separate lease tax system with a lower rate is relatively uncommon.

**Comparison to General Rates:**
- General Sales Tax: 4% state
- General Rental Tax: 4% state
- Automotive Sales: 2% state (50% reduction)
- Automotive Lease: 1.5% state (62.5% reduction)

### 4.2 Trade-In Treatment Differences

**Feature:** Dramatically different trade-in treatment between sales and leases

| Transaction Type | Trade-In Treatment | Tax Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Purchase (Sale)** | Reduces taxable amount for STATE tax only | Saves buyer 2% on trade-in value |
| **Lease** | NO reduction; trade-in equity taxed as cap cost reduction | COSTS buyer 1.5% on trade-in value |

**Example Impact:**
```
$10,000 Trade-In Value

PURCHASE:
State tax savings:             $200 (2% of $10,000 saved)
Local tax:                     No savings (still pay on full amount)

LEASE:
State tax cost:                $150 (1.5% of $10,000 - TAXED)
Local tax cost:                Additional local lease tax on trade-in
```

This creates a significant economic difference between purchasing and leasing for customers with trade-ins.

### 4.3 Partial Trade-In Credit (State vs. Local)

**Feature:** Trade-in credit applies ONLY to state tax, NOT local taxes

**How It Works:**
- State 2% tax: Applied to net price after trade-in deduction
- Local taxes: Applied to gross purchase price (NO trade-in deduction)

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Price:                 $30,000
Trade-In Value:                $10,000

State Tax (2%):
  Taxable Amount:              $20,000 (after trade-in)
  Tax Due:                     $400

Local Tax (4% combined):
  Taxable Amount:              $30,000 (NO trade-in credit)
  Tax Due:                     $1,200

Total Tax:                     $1,600
```

**Why Unique:** Most states apply trade-in credit uniformly to all tax rates. Alabama's bifurcated system is unusual and can create confusion.

### 4.4 Drive-Out Provision (72-Hour Rule)

**Feature:** Out-of-state buyers receive preferential tax treatment

**Unique Aspects:**
1. **Tax Cap:** Alabama tax capped at destination state's rate
2. **Local Tax Exemption:** No county/city taxes on drive-out sales
3. **Zero-Tax Possibility:** Buyers from no-tax states (MT, OR, DE, NH) pay $0 Alabama tax

**Competitive Advantage:** Alabama dealers can attract out-of-state buyers by offering lower effective tax rates than buyers' home states.

### 4.5 Manufacturer Rebate Taxation

**Feature:** Rebates do NOT reduce taxable amount

**Impact:** Alabama buyers pay tax on full MSRP even with large manufacturer rebates

**Example:**
```
MSRP:                          $35,000
Manufacturer Rebate:           $5,000
Customer Price:                $30,000
Tax Base:                      $35,000 (NOT reduced by rebate)
State Tax (2%):                $700 (on $35,000, not $30,000)
```

**Why Notable:** Some states allow rebates to reduce tax base. Alabama does not, which increases effective tax burden on vehicles with large rebates.

### 4.6 No Cap on Documentation Fees

**Feature:** Alabama has NO statutory limit on dealer doc fees

**Impact:**
- Average doc fee: $485
- Some dealers charge $600+
- Significant variation between dealers
- Doc fees are taxable, increasing their effective cost

**Example Cost:**
```
Doc Fee:                       $595
State Tax (2%):                $11.90
Local Tax (3%):                $17.85
Total Cost:                    $624.75
```

**Why Notable:** Many states cap doc fees at $75-$200. Alabama's lack of regulation allows much higher fees.

### 4.7 Casual Sale Taxation

**Feature:** Private party sales are taxed at same rates as dealer sales

**Application:**
- 2% state automotive tax applies to private sales
- Local taxes also apply
- Casual Sale and Use Tax paid at time of registration
- Limited exemptions (gifts, charitable organizations)

**Why Notable:** Ensures tax equity between dealer and private party sales, but unusual name "Casual Sale and Use Tax" sometimes causes confusion.

### 4.8 Electric Vehicle (EV) Taxation

**Feature:** NO state sales tax exemption for EVs, but additional registration fees

#### Sales Tax Treatment
- EVs taxed same as conventional vehicles
- No state-level sales tax exemption or reduction
- Federal rebates ($7,500 new, $4,000 used) ARE taxable when applied as cap reduction on leases

#### EV Registration Fees (Annual)
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV):** $203/year additional fee
- **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV):** $103/year additional fee
- Fees increase by $3 every four years

**Why Notable:** Alabama actually penalizes EV ownership with higher registration fees to compensate for lost gas tax revenue, while providing no sales tax incentive.

## 5. COUNTY AND REGIONAL DIFFERENCES

### 5.1 Major County Rate Variations

Alabama's 67 counties have widely varying local tax rates:

| County | State | Local | Total | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Jefferson** | 2.0% | 4.0% | 6.0% | Includes Birmingham |
| **Mobile** | 2.0% | 8.0% | 10.0% | Highest in state |
| **Baldwin** | 2.0% | 0.5% | 2.5% | Coastal county, low rate |
| **Madison** | 2.0% | 2.5% | 4.5% | Huntsville area |
| **Montgomery** | 2.0% | 4.5% | 6.5% | State capital |
| **Shelby** | 2.0% | 3.0% | 5.0% | South of Birmingham |
| **Tuscaloosa** | 2.0% | 3.0% | 5.0% | Home of U of Alabama |
| **Blount** | 2.0% | 0.5% | 2.5% | Rural county |

### 5.2 Municipal Additional Taxes

Many cities levy additional sales taxes on top of county rates:

**High-Tax Cities:**
- **Mobile:** 5.0% city tax (+ county = 10.0% total)
- **Birmingham:** 2.0% city tax (+ 2.0% county = 6.0% total)
- **Montgomery:** Additional city tax (6.5% total)

**Lower-Tax Cities:**
- **Huntsville:** Moderate rates (4.5% total)
- **Gulf Shores:** Tourist area with varying rates

### 5.3 Tax Collection Point

**Rule:** Dealer collects tax based on **dealership location**, not buyer residence

**Impact:** Buyers can potentially save by purchasing from dealers in lower-tax jurisdictions

**Example:**
```
Buyer lives in Mobile (10% total):
  Option 1 - Buy in Mobile:    $30,000 × 10% = $3,000 tax
  Option 2 - Buy in Baldwin:   $30,000 × 2.5% = $750 tax
  Savings:                     $2,250
```

**Caveat:** Use tax may apply if buyer's home jurisdiction rate is higher than purchase location rate. Consult Alabama Department of Revenue for specific situations.

## 6. HISTORICAL CHANGES AND TRENDS

### 6.1 Recent Rate Changes

**2022 - Drive-Out Provision Enacted:**
- Effective July 1, 2022
- Major change to benefit out-of-state buyers
- Eliminated local taxes for drive-out sales
- Capped state tax at destination state rate

**2020s - Title Fee Increase:**
- Title fee increased from $16.50 to $25.00
- Approximately 50% increase
- Still tax-exempt when separately stated

**2017-2018 - EV Fees Introduced:**
- Annual registration fees for EVs added
- BEV: $203/year, PHEV: $103/year
- Designed to compensate for lost gas tax revenue
- Increase by $3 every four years

### 6.2 Local Rate Trends

**General Trend:** Increasing local tax rates across most counties

- Many counties have added 0.5% to 1.0% over past decade
- School district taxes in some areas
- Infrastructure improvement taxes

**Mobile County Example:**
- Mobile has one of highest combined rates in state
- 10.0% total rate makes it challenging for dealers to compete with lower-tax areas

### 6.3 Stability of Automotive Rate

**Stable:** The 2% state automotive rate has remained unchanged for many years

**Unlikely to Change:** The reduced automotive rate is well-established in Alabama tax law and unlikely to increase, as:
- Strong dealer lobby
- Recognition that vehicles are essential, not luxury
- Competitive pressure from neighboring states

### 6.4 Future Considerations

**Potential Changes to Watch:**
1. **EV Fee Adjustments:** As EV adoption increases, registration fees may be adjusted
2. **Use Tax Enforcement:** Increasing focus on use tax compliance for online and out-of-state purchases
3. **Local Rate Increases:** Counties may continue to raise local rates to fund services
4. **Digital Sales Tax:** Potential changes to how online vehicle sales are taxed

### 8.2 Calculation Logic

#### PURCHASE (RETAIL SALE) CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Net Taxable Amount for STATE TAX
  Net_State = Sale_Price - Trade_In_Value
  (Do NOT subtract manufacturer rebates)

STEP 2: Calculate Gross Taxable Amount for LOCAL TAX
  Gross_Local = Sale_Price
  (NO trade-in deduction)

STEP 3: Calculate State Automotive Tax
  State_Tax = Net_State × 0.02

STEP 4: Calculate Local Tax
  Local_Tax = Gross_Local × Local_Rate

STEP 5: Add Taxable Fees
  Doc_Fee_Tax = Doc_Fee × (0.02 + Local_Rate)
  Other_Fee_Tax = Other_Taxable_Fees × (0.02 + Local_Rate)

STEP 6: Exclude Non-Taxable Items
  Title_Fee_Tax = 0  (if separately stated)
  VSC_Tax = 0
  GAP_Tax = 0

STEP 7: Calculate Total Sales Tax
  Total_Tax = State_Tax + Local_Tax + Doc_Fee_Tax + Other_Fee_Tax

STEP 8: Calculate Total Amount Due
  Total_Due = Sale_Price - Trade_In_Value + Total_Tax + Non_Taxable_Fees
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
Sale Price:                    $30,000.00
Trade-In Value:                -$10,000.00
Doc Fee:                       $495.00
Title Fee:                     $25.00
VSC:                           $1,500.00
GAP:                           $695.00

State Tax Base:                $20,000.00  ($30k - $10k trade)
Local Tax Base:                $30,000.00  (NO trade deduction)

State Tax (2%):                $400.00
Local Tax (4%):                $1,200.00
Doc Fee Tax (6%):              $29.70
Title Fee Tax:                 $0.00  (separately stated)
VSC Tax:                       $0.00  (not taxable)
GAP Tax:                       $0.00  (not taxable)

Total Sales Tax:               $1,629.70

Amount Due:
  Sale Price:                  $30,000.00
  Less Trade-In:               -$10,000.00
  Plus Sales Tax:              +$1,629.70
  Plus Doc Fee:                +$495.00
  Plus Title Fee:              +$25.00
  Plus VSC:                    +$1,500.00
  Plus GAP:                    +$695.00
  Total Due:                   $24,344.70
```

#### LEASE CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Calculate Tax on Cap Cost Reductions (Due at Inception)
  Cap_Reduction_Tax = Total_Cap_Reductions × (0.015 + Local_Lease_Rate)

  Components of Total_Cap_Reductions:
  - Cash down payment
  - Manufacturer rebates
  - Trade-in equity (FULLY TAXABLE - no credit)
  - Dealer discounts
  - Any other cap cost reductions

STEP 2: Calculate Monthly Lease Tax
  Monthly_Tax = Monthly_Payment × (0.015 + Local_Lease_Rate)

STEP 3: Calculate Total Lease Tax Over Term
  Total_Lease_Tax = Cap_Reduction_Tax + (Monthly_Tax × Lease_Term_Months)

STEP 4: Add Backend Product Costs (Not Taxable)
  VSC_Cost = VSC_Amount (no tax)
  GAP_Cost = GAP_Amount (no tax)

STEP 5: Calculate Due at Signing
  Due_At_Signing = Cap_Reductions + Cap_Reduction_Tax + First_Payment + Monthly_Tax + Registration_Fees + Non_Taxable_Products

STEP 6: Calculate Monthly Payment to Customer
  Total_Monthly = Base_Monthly_Payment + Monthly_Tax
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
LEASE TERMS:
Cap Cost:                      $35,000.00
Cap Cost Reductions:
  Cash Down:                   $3,000.00
  Manufacturer Rebate:         $2,000.00
  Trade-In Equity:             $5,000.00  (TAXABLE)
  Total Cap Reductions:        $10,000.00
Adjusted Cap Cost:             $25,000.00
Monthly Payment (base):        $450.00
Lease Term:                    36 months
State Lease Rate:              1.5%
Local Lease Rate:              2.0%
Combined Rate:                 3.5%

CAP REDUCTION TAX (Due at Inception):
  $10,000 × 3.5%:              $350.00

MONTHLY LEASE TAX:
  $450 × 3.5%:                 $15.75

TOTAL LEASE TAX (36 months):
  Inception:                   $350.00
  Monthly: $15.75 × 36:        $567.00
  Total:                       $917.00

CUSTOMER COSTS:
Due at Signing:
  Cap Reductions:              $10,000.00

  Total:                       $28,467.00
```

#### OUT-OF-STATE BUYER (DRIVE-OUT) CALCULATION:

```
STEP 1: Verify Drive-Out Eligibility
  - Buyer is resident of another state?
  - Vehicle will be removed within 72 hours?
  - Vehicle will be registered in another state?
  If NO to any: Use standard calculation

STEP 2: Determine Buyer's Home State Rate
  Home_State_Rate = [lookup buyer's state automotive tax rate]

STEP 3: Calculate Alabama Tax (Capped)
  AL_Tax_Rate = MIN(0.02, Home_State_Rate)
  AL_Tax = Sale_Price × AL_Tax_Rate

  Local_Tax = $0.00  (exempt under drive-out provision)

STEP 4: Add Taxable Fees
  Doc_Fee_Tax = Doc_Fee × AL_Tax_Rate

STEP 5: Calculate Total Alabama Tax
  Total_AL_Tax = AL_Tax + Doc_Fee_Tax

STEP 6: Document for Buyer
  Provide calculation showing:
  - Alabama tax paid
  - Expected home state tax due
  - Credit buyer should claim in home state
```

**Example Implementation:**
```
GEORGIA BUYER (Drive-Out):
Vehicle Price:                 $28,000.00
Trade-In:                      $8,000.00
Doc Fee:                       $495.00
GA Sales Tax Rate:             7.0%

Alabama Tax Calculation:
  Tax Base (net):              $20,000.00
  AL State Rate:               2.0%  (GA rate 7% > AL 2%, so use 2%)
  AL State Tax:                $400.00
  AL Local Tax:                $0.00  (drive-out exempt)
  Doc Fee Tax (2%):            $9.90
  Total AL Tax:                $409.90

Expected GA Tax:
  Tax Base:                    $20,000.00  (net after trade-in)
  GA State+Local:              7.0%
  GA Tax:                      $1,400.00
  Credit for AL tax:           -$409.90
  Additional GA tax due:       $990.10

Documentation to Buyer:
  "You will pay $409.90 in Alabama sales tax. When registering
   in Georgia, you will owe approximately $990.10 additional
   tax after credit for Alabama tax paid. Total effective tax:
   $1,400.00."
```

### 8.3 Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

#### Edge Case 1: Negative Equity on Purchase

  Negative Equity:             $3,000.00
  Total Financed:              $17,010.00

NOTE: Negative equity is NOT taxable on purchases
```

#### Edge Case 2: Negative Equity on Lease
```
Lease Cap Cost:                $30,000.00
Trade-In Value:                $12,000.00
Trade-In Payoff:               -$15,000.00
Negative Equity:               -$3,000.00

  Adjusted Cap Cost:           $33,000.00

LEASE TAX ON NEGATIVE EQUITY:
  Negative equity is taxed:    $3,000 × 3.5% = $105.00
  (Due at lease inception)

NOTE: Negative equity IS taxable on leases
```

#### Edge Case 3: Accessories Purchased at Delivery
```
Vehicle sold with accessories included:
  Vehicle Price:               $28,000.00
  Accessories (in contract):   $2,000.00
  Total Sale Price:            $30,000.00
  Tax Rate:                    5% combined
  Tax on accessories:          2% + 3% = 5% = $100.00

Accessories purchased day after delivery:
  Accessories:                 $2,000.00
  Tax Rate:                    4% state + 3% local = 7%
  Tax on accessories:          $140.00

Difference:                    $40.00 higher tax if purchased separately
```

#### Edge Case 4: Large Manufacturer Rebate
```
MSRP:                          $40,000.00
Manufacturer Rebate:           -$8,000.00
Customer Pays:                 $32,000.00

TAX CALCULATION:
  State Tax Base:              $40,000.00  (rebate does NOT reduce)
  State Tax (2%):              $800.00

  Local Tax Base:              $40,000.00
  Local Tax (4%):              $1,600.00

  Total Tax:                   $2,400.00

Customer feels this as:
  Paid $32,000 but taxed on $40,000 = 7.5% effective rate
  vs. expected 6% rate = $1,920
  "Extra" tax due to rebate:   $480.00
```

#### Edge Case 5: Out-of-State Buyer from No-Tax State
```
MONTANA BUYER (0% sales tax state):
Vehicle Price:                 $35,000.00
Trade-In:                      None
MT Sales Tax:                  0%

Alabama Tax under Drive-Out:
  AL Rate:                     2%
  MT Rate:                     0%
  Tax Charged:                 MIN(2%, 0%) = 0%

  State Tax:                   $0.00
  Local Tax:                   $0.00 (drive-out exempt)
  Total AL Tax:                $0.00

Buyer pays ZERO sales tax (if qualifies for drive-out provision)
```
