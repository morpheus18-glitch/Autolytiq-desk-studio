## 1. RETAIL SALES TAX

### 1.1 State Tax Rate

**Rate:** 6.875% of the taxable purchase price
**Effective Date:** July 1, 2023 (increased from 6.5%)
**Legal Authority:** Minnesota Statute § 297B.02

**Historical Context:**
- Pre-July 1, 2023: 6.5%
- July 1, 2023 - Present: 6.875%

The 0.375% increase was part of a 2023 transportation funding package directed primarily to Greater Minnesota transit.

### 1.2 Local Sales Tax

**IMPORTANT:** Local sales taxes do NOT apply to motor vehicle purchases in Minnesota.

Minnesota is one of the few states where local option sales taxes (which can be as high as 1.5% for general purchases) are **explicitly excluded** for motor vehicles. Instead, motor vehicles are subject only to:
1. State motor vehicle excise tax (6.875%)
2. Optional local vehicle excise tax ($20 flat fee - see section 1.3)

**Source:** Minnesota Department of Revenue, Motor Vehicle Sales Guide

### 1.3 Local Vehicle Excise Tax

Some Minnesota counties and cities impose a **$20 flat local vehicle excise tax** per vehicle (not a percentage). This is separate from the motor vehicle sales tax and is used to fund local transportation projects.

**Application:** Collected at time of registration/title transfer
**Amount:** Fixed $20 (not based on vehicle value)
**Jurisdictions:** Various metro and Greater Minnesota counties/cities

**Note:** This is NOT a sales tax - it's a separate registration-related fee.

### 1.4 Trade-In Credit Policy

**Policy:** FULL trade-in credit (no cap)

Minnesota provides 100% credit for trade-in value against the purchase price of a motor vehicle.

**Statutory Definition (§ 297B.01, Subd. 14a):**
> "If a motor vehicle is taken in trade as a credit or as part payment on a motor vehicle taxable under this chapter, the credit or trade-in value allowed by the person selling the motor vehicle shall be deducted from the total selling price to establish the purchase price of the vehicle being sold."

**Requirements:**
- Trade-in must be a motor vehicle traded for another motor vehicle
- Trade-in value allowed by dealer is deducted from total selling price
- No limit or cap on trade-in credit amount

**Exception:** Trading an **off-road vehicle** (ATV, snowmobile, etc.) for a motor vehicle does NOT reduce the taxable price.

**Example:**
```
Vehicle Purchase Price:     $35,000
Trade-In Allowance:        -$15,000
Manufacturer Rebate:        -$2,000
─────────────────────────────────
Taxable Purchase Price:     $18,000
Tax @ 6.875%:               $1,237.50
```

**Source:** Minnesota Statute § 297B.01, Subd. 14; MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide

### 1.5 Manufacturer Rebate Treatment

**Treatment:** NOT taxable (rebates reduce taxable purchase price)

All manufacturer rebates are deducted from the sales price **before** calculating sales tax.

**Statutory Exclusion (§ 297B.01, Subd. 14b):**
> "Purchase price does not include... amounts representing manufacturer's rebates paid to the purchaser"

**Requirements:**
- Rebate must have a fixed value at time of purchase
- Applies to manufacturer rebates paid directly to purchaser
- Applies to manufacturer rebates assigned to dealer on behalf of purchaser

**Third-Party Rebates:** Also deductible if issued by third parties who entered into an agreement with vehicle manufacturers (e.g., credit card company incentive programs partnered with manufacturers).

**Federal EV Tax Credits:**
- If applied as an upfront dealer discount at point of sale: **Reduces taxable price**
- If claimed later on federal tax return: **Does NOT reduce taxable price**

**Source:** Minnesota Statute § 297B.01, Subd. 14; MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide

### 1.6 Dealer Rebate/Incentive Treatment

**Treatment:** Dealer incentives reduce taxable price (same as manufacturer rebates)

Minnesota does not distinguish between manufacturer rebates and dealer incentives for tax purposes. The statute broadly excludes "manufacturer's rebates" and "rebates issued by third parties" from the purchase price.

**Practical Application:**
- **Dealer cash/incentive paid to dealer by manufacturer:** Reduces purchase price if passed to customer
- **Dealer discount from advertised price:** Reduces purchase price (standard negotiation)
- **Dealer participation in rebate programs:** Treated same as manufacturer rebates

**Key Principle:** Any rebate or discount that reduces the actual consideration paid by the customer reduces the taxable purchase price.

**Source:** Minnesota Department of Revenue, Motor Vehicle Sales Guide

### 1.7 Documentation Fee Taxability

**Treatment:** NOT taxable

Documentation fees (also called "doc fees" or "document administration fees") are **explicitly excluded** from the taxable purchase price.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide):**
> "Tax should not be charged on: Registration, license, and document fees"

**Statutory Cap:**
- Minnesota Statute § 168.27, Subd. 31 regulates maximum doc fees
- Average doc fee in Minnesota: $75
- Recent legislative discussions considered caps around $125-$150
- Doc fees must be separately stated on sales agreement
- Doc fees may be excluded from dealer's advertised price

**Requirements:**
- Fee must be for services actually rendered
- Services include: preparing, handling, and processing documents for closing
- Must be separately stated on purchase agreement

**Source:** Minnesota Statute § 168.27, Subd. 31; MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide

### 1.8 Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) Taxability

**Treatment:** NOT taxable

Vehicle Service Contracts (VSCs), also called extended warranties or maintenance contracts, are **NOT subject to motor vehicle sales tax** in Minnesota.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide):**
> "Tax should not be charged on: Extended warranties"

**Distinction from General Sales Tax:**
When VSCs are sold separately from a vehicle (e.g., after-market), they may be subject to the **general sales tax rate of 6.875%** (not motor vehicle sales tax), and the tax is due when the contract is sold, not when service is performed.

**Best Practice for Dealers:**
- VSC should be separately stated on purchase agreement
- Not included in motor vehicle purchase price for tax calculation
- Keep documentation showing VSC as separate optional product

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide; MN DOR Warranties and Service Contracts Guide

### 1.9 GAP Insurance Taxability

**Treatment:** NOT taxable

Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance is **NOT subject to motor vehicle sales tax** in Minnesota.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Do not charge sales tax on: Insurance"

GAP is classified as an insurance product, which is exempt from sales tax in Minnesota.

**Minnesota-Specific Rule on GAP Claims:**
Minnesota requires insurers to include **future sales tax** as part of total-loss settlement checks. This affects GAP calculations because:
1. Primary insurance settlement includes sales tax reimbursement
2. GAP coverage helps pay difference between settlement and loan balance
3. Sales tax component is included in determining total loss value

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide; Insurance industry guidance

### 1.10 Accessories Taxability

**Treatment:** TAXABLE

All accessories sold with a motor vehicle, including parts and labor for installation, are subject to motor vehicle sales tax.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide):**
> "Charges for accessories (e.g., running boards and mud flaps) are included in the motor vehicle sales tax calculation."

**What's Included:**
- Factory-installed accessories (included in base purchase price)
- Dealer-added accessories (running boards, mud flaps, cargo liners, etc.)
- Aftermarket accessories installed before delivery
- Labor charges for installation
- Appearance packages (pinstriping, window tinting, paint protection)
- Performance packages (cold air intakes, exhaust systems)
- Technology accessories (remote starters, navigation systems, dash cams)

**Labor Charges:**
> "Charges for labor performed (e.g., rustproofing, undercoating, dealer preparation, and transportation)" are taxable.

**Exception - Disability Modifications:**
Charges for parts, accessories, and labor to make a vehicle disability accessible are **NOT taxable**.

**Calculation:**
```
Base Vehicle Price:           $30,000
Running Boards + Install:     $    800
Window Tint + Install:        $    400
Dealer Prep (taxable):        $    300
─────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal:                     $31,500
Trade-In:                     -$10,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Purchase Price:       $21,500
Tax @ 6.875%:                 $ 1,478.13
```

### 1.11 Negative Equity Treatment

**Treatment:** NOT explicitly addressed in Minnesota law (likely NOT taxable)

Minnesota statutes do not explicitly address whether negative equity rolled into a new vehicle loan is subject to sales tax.

**Legal Analysis:**

**Purchase Price Definition (§ 297B.01, Subd. 14a):**
> "Purchase price means the total consideration valued in money for a sale, whether paid in money or otherwise"

The statute defines purchase price based on:
- The actual sale transaction of the new vehicle
- Minus rebates and trade-in allowances
- Plus taxable add-ons (accessories, labor)

**Key Point:** "Purchase price" refers to consideration for the **new vehicle**, not the total amount financed.

**Amount Financed vs. Purchase Price:**
```
New Vehicle Price:              $30,000
Trade-In Actual Value:          $ 8,000
Trade-In Payoff (Negative):     $12,000
Negative Equity Rolled:         $ 4,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Amount Financed:                $26,000  ← NOT the taxable base
Purchase Price for Tax:         $22,000  ← Vehicle price minus trade value
Tax @ 6.875%:                   $ 1,512.50
```

**Conservative Interpretation:**
Negative equity represents a **debt obligation** from the previous vehicle, not consideration paid for the new vehicle. It's rolled into the loan but is not part of the new vehicle's purchase price.

**Best Practice:**
- Calculate tax on: New Vehicle Price - Trade-In Allowance
- Do NOT add negative equity to taxable base
- Clearly document on purchase agreement

**Recommendation:** For definitive guidance, contact Minnesota Department of Revenue or consult a Minnesota tax attorney, as no published revenue notice specifically addresses this scenario.

## 2. LEASE TAXATION

### 2.1 Lease Tax Method

**Method:** UPFRONT taxation on total lease price

Minnesota requires sales tax to be calculated and paid **upfront** on the sum of all lease payments, rather than charging tax on individual monthly payments.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Sales tax is collected on the total up-front lease price and reported on your next Sales and Use Tax return."

**Tax Rate:** 6.875% (same as purchase rate) plus applicable local sales taxes

**Important Note:** Unlike motor vehicle **purchases** (which are exempt from local sales tax), motor vehicle **leases** ARE subject to local sales taxes. This means lessees in metro areas may pay total sales tax rates of 8.375% or higher.

**Total Lease Price Calculation:**
```
Vehicle Capitalized Cost (Cap Cost)
  MINUS: Residual Value
  MINUS: Trade-In Allowance (if any)
  MINUS: Rebates (manufacturer/dealer)
  PLUS:  Taxable Add-Ons (accessories installed)
  PLUS:  Interest/Finance Charges (money factor cost)
  ────────────────────────────────────
  = Total Lease Price (taxable base)

  × Tax Rate (6.875% + local taxes)
  ────────────────────────────────────
  = Upfront Sales Tax Due
```

**Example:**
```
Vehicle MSRP:                    $40,000
Capitalized Cost:                $38,000
Residual Value (36 months):     -$22,000
Manufacturer Rebate:             -$ 1,500
Interest/Finance Charges:        +$ 2,500
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Lease Price:               $17,000
Tax @ 7.375% (incl local):       $ 1,253.75 (due upfront)
```

**Financing the Tax:**
Customers may choose to roll the upfront tax back into the capitalized cost and finance it over the lease term. If the tax is financed:
- Do NOT include the finance charge on the tax in the taxable amount
- Only the original tax amount is taxable

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide; Minnesota Statute § 297A.61

### 2.2 Capitalized Cost Reduction (Cap Cost Reduction)

**Treatment:** Reduces monthly payment BUT does NOT reduce vehicle value for tax purposes

This is a critical and often misunderstood aspect of Minnesota lease taxation.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Cash down payments or capitalized cost reductions do not reduce the vehicle value."

**What is Cap Cost Reduction?**
Any combination of:
- Cash down payment
- Credits or rebates applied at signing
- Manufacturer incentives
- First month's payment paid upfront
- Security deposit (non-refundable portion)

**Tax Treatment:**
- Cap cost reduction **DOES** lower monthly lease payments
- Cap cost reduction **DOES NOT** lower the taxable lease price for sales tax purposes

**Exception - Rebates:**
If the cap cost reduction includes **manufacturer rebates**, those rebates DO reduce the vehicle value (see section 2.5).

**Example:**
```
Scenario 1: With $3,000 Cash Down Payment
─────────────────────────────────────────
Vehicle Cap Cost:                  $35,000
Cap Cost Reduction (cash):         -$ 3,000
Adjusted Cap Cost:                 $32,000
Residual Value:                    -$20,000
Interest Charges:                  +$ 2,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Lease Price:                 $17,000  ← Tax calculated on this
Tax @ 6.875%:                      $ 1,168.75

Monthly Payment (36 months):       $888.89 + $32.47 tax = $921.36
```

**Why This Matters:**
In many states, a larger down payment reduces the tax burden. In Minnesota, down payments reduce the monthly payment amount but do NOT reduce the total tax paid over the lease.

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide

### 2.3 Trade-In Credit on Leases

**Treatment:** Trade-in allowance DOES reduce vehicle value (and therefore tax)

Unlike cash down payments, trading in a vehicle **does reduce** the taxable lease price.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Trade-in allowance reduces the vehicle value when the lessor accepts a used vehicle as part of the lease transaction."

**Requirements:**
1. **Customer must own the trade-in** (cannot trade-in a leased vehicle to reduce tax)
2. **Trade directly to lessor** named on the lease agreement
3. **Trade-in value is determined by dealer/lessor** (not payoff amount)

**Critical Rule - Payoff Amount:**
> "The payoff amount to a lender does not reduce the trade-in allowance."

This means if you owe more than the vehicle is worth (negative equity):
- Tax benefit is based on actual trade-in **value**, not payoff
- Negative equity does not increase the taxable lease price
- Positive equity reduces the taxable lease price

**Example - Positive Equity:**
```
Vehicle Cap Cost:                  $35,000
Trade-In Value:                    $ 8,000  ← Reduces taxable price
Trade-In Payoff:                   $ 5,000  ← Dealer pays this, not relevant to tax
Residual Value:                    -$20,000
Interest Charges:                  +$ 2,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Lease Price:                 $ 9,000  ← Tax calculated on this
Tax @ 6.875%:                      $  618.75 (vs. $1,168.75 without trade)
```

**Example - Negative Equity:**
```
Vehicle Cap Cost:                  $35,000
Trade-In Value:                    $ 6,000  ← Reduces taxable price
Trade-In Payoff:                   $10,000  ← Negative equity rolled into cap cost
Effective Cap Cost:                $39,000  ← For payment calculation
Residual Value:                    -$20,000
Interest Charges:                  +$ 2,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Lease Price (for tax):       $17,000  ← Based on $35K - $6K - $20K + $2K
Tax @ 6.875%:                      $ 1,168.75
```

### 2.4 Backend Product Taxability (Leases)

**Treatment:** VSC and GAP premiums are NOT taxable on leases

Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC) and GAP insurance purchased with a lease are exempt from sales tax.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Do not charge sales tax on: Acquisition, document, title, and registration fees; Insurance; Warranty or extended warranty contracts"

**What's Excluded from Lease Tax:**
- GAP insurance/waiver
- Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC)
- Maintenance plans
- Tire & wheel protection
- Key replacement coverage
- Windshield protection
- Paintless dent repair plans

**What IS Included in Lease Tax:**
- Accessories installed on vehicle (running boards, tint, etc.)
- Labor charges for customization
- Appearance packages
- Technology upgrades installed before delivery

**Best Practice:**
- Separately itemize backend products on lease agreement
- Show VSC/GAP as non-taxable line items
- Calculate tax only on vehicle lease price + taxable add-ons

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide

### 2.5 Documentation Fee Treatment on Leases

**Treatment:** NOT taxable

Same as purchases, documentation fees on leases are exempt from sales tax.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Do not charge sales tax on: Acquisition, document, title, and registration fees"

**Acquisition Fee vs. Documentation Fee:**
- **Acquisition Fee:** Charged by lessor (captive finance) to initiate lease - NOT taxable
- **Doc Fee:** Charged by dealer for administrative processing - NOT taxable
- Both must be separately stated on lease agreement

**Other Non-Taxable Lease Fees:**
- Title fees
- Registration fees
- License fees
- Disposition fee (charged at lease end)

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide; Minnesota Statute § 168.27, Subd. 31

### 2.6 Lease Renewal Taxation

**Treatment:** Sales tax is due upfront for lease renewals

When a customer renews or extends an existing lease, Minnesota requires sales tax on the renewal term to be paid upfront.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Sales tax is due up front for lease renewals"

**Calculation:**
- Tax is calculated on the total payments for the renewal period
- Same formula as original lease
- Prior tax payments do NOT carry over

**Example:**
```
Original Lease: 36 months, tax paid upfront in Year 1
Renewal: 12 months

Renewal Calculation:
────────────────────────────────────────
Total Renewal Payments (12 months):  $6,000
Interest/Finance Charges:            $  400
────────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Renewal Price:               $6,400
Tax @ 6.875%:                        $  440 (due upfront at renewal)
```

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide

### 2.7 Excess Mileage & Wear Fees

**Treatment:** Subject to sales tax

Excess mileage charges and excessive wear-and-tear fees assessed at lease termination are subject to sales tax.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Leases Guide):**
> "Excess mileage fees: Subject to sales tax"

**When Tax Applies:**
- Assessed at end of lease
- Dealer/lessor must collect sales tax on these fees
- Reported on sales tax return in the month fees are collected

**Example:**
```
Lease Allowance: 36,000 miles (36 months × 1,000 miles/month)
Actual Mileage:  42,000 miles
Excess Miles:     6,000 miles
Rate:            $0.25/mile
────────────────────────────────────────
Excess Mileage Fee:  $1,500.00
Tax @ 6.875%:        $  103.13
────────────────────────────────────────
Total Due at Turn-In: $1,603.13
```

## 3. RECIPROCITY & INTERSTATE TRANSACTIONS

### 3.1 Credit for Taxes Paid to Other States

**Policy:** Credit allowed, with Minnesota rate as minimum

Minnesota residents who purchase vehicles in another state and pay that state's sales tax can claim a **credit** against Minnesota motor vehicle sales tax.

**Official Guidance (MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide):**
> "If a Minnesota resident registered and paid sales tax to another state, Minnesota allows credit for tax paid to the other state. If the other state's tax rate is lower, then tax is due on the difference in rates to Minnesota."

**How It Works:**

**Scenario 1: Other State Rate Higher**
```
Vehicle purchased in Wisconsin
Purchase Price:               $25,000
Wisconsin Sales Tax (5%):     $ 1,250  ← Paid to Wisconsin

Minnesota Credit:             $ 1,250  ← Full credit
Minnesota Tax Due:            $     0  ← No additional tax (WI rate > MN rate)
```

**Scenario 2: Other State Rate Lower**
```
Vehicle purchased in Montana (no sales tax)
Purchase Price:               $25,000
Montana Sales Tax:            $     0  ← Paid to Montana

Minnesota Tax Due:
  $25,000 × 6.875%            $ 1,718.75
  Credit for Montana Tax:     -$     0
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Amount Due to Minnesota:    $ 1,718.75
```

**Scenario 3: Other State Rate Lower (Non-Zero)**
```
Vehicle purchased in North Dakota
Purchase Price:               $25,000
North Dakota Sales Tax (5%):  $ 1,250  ← Paid to North Dakota

Minnesota Tax Due:
  $25,000 × 6.875%            $ 1,718.75
  Credit for ND Tax:          -$ 1,250.00
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Amount Due to Minnesota:    $   468.75
```

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of sales tax payment to other state
- Bill of sale or purchase agreement
- Tax receipt from other state DMV/DOR

**When Tax is Collected:**
Tax is paid to a deputy registrar or Minnesota Driver and Vehicle Services when the vehicle is registered/titled in Minnesota.

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide; Minnesota Statute § 297B.02

### 3.2 Special Reciprocity Rules

**Income Tax Reciprocity (Unrelated to Vehicle Sales):**
Minnesota has income tax reciprocity agreements with **Michigan** and **North Dakota** for wages and personal service income. This does NOT apply to vehicle sales tax.

**Nonresident Vehicle Purchases:**
Minnesota dealers selling to nonresidents typically must collect Minnesota sales tax unless:
1. Vehicle will be registered in another state AND
2. Immediately transported out of Minnesota AND
3. Proper documentation is provided

Dealers must follow specific procedures for nonresident sales to avoid collecting Minnesota tax.

**Military Personnel:**
Active-duty military members stationed in Minnesota but maintaining residency in another state may be exempt from Minnesota motor vehicle sales tax if:
- Vehicle is registered in their home state
- Military orders establish non-Minnesota residency

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Industry Guide; Minnesota Statute § 297B.03

### 3.3 Out-of-State Purchase Registration Timeline

Minnesota residents who purchase vehicles out of state must pay Minnesota sales tax when registering the vehicle in Minnesota, typically within **60 days** of purchase.

**60-Day Residency Rule (Exemption):**
Under Minnesota Statute § 297B.03, Subd. 3(a), an exemption exists for:
> "Vehicles purchased by persons who were residents of another state or country more than 60 days prior to becoming Minnesota residents and registered the vehicle in that state or country"

**Practical Application:**
- If you lived in Wisconsin for 5 years, bought a car there, then moved to Minnesota 3 months later: **NO Minnesota tax due**
- If you bought a car in Wisconsin while living in Minnesota: **Minnesota tax due** when you register it

## 4. UNIQUE MINNESOTA FEATURES

### 4.1 Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro Transit Tax

**Transit Tax Increase (Effective October 1, 2023):**
In 2023, the Minnesota Legislature passed a **0.75% regional transportation sales tax** for the seven-county Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.

**Impact on Motor Vehicles:**
- Motor vehicle **purchases**: NOT subject to this local tax (only state MVET applies)
- Motor vehicle **leases**: Subject to both state + local taxes (including the 0.75% transit tax)
- General sales tax in metro area now tops **8%** (6.875% state + local + transit)

**Geographic Coverage:**
Seven-county metro area:
1. Hennepin County
2. Ramsey County
3. Dakota County
4. Anoka County
5. Washington County
6. Scott County
7. Carver County

**Revenue Use:**
Funds transit improvements including:
- Metro Transit bus and light rail service
- Regional bus systems
- Transit infrastructure
- Accessibility improvements

**Motor Vehicle Registration Tax Increase (Effective January 1, 2024):**
The 2023 transportation bill also increased motor vehicle **registration fees** by modifying the depreciation schedule and core rate. This generates additional revenue for Greater Minnesota transit.

**Delivery Fee:**
A **$0.50 delivery fee** was added to orders over $100 in the metro area, effective 2024.

- **July 1, 2023-Present:** 6.875%

**2023 Increase Context:**
The 0.375% increase (from 6.5% to 6.875%) was part of a comprehensive transportation funding package. The additional revenue is dedicated to:
- Greater Minnesota transit systems
- Rural transit provider subsidies
- Accessibility improvements
- Transit capital projects

**Source:** Minnesota House Research, Motor Vehicle Sales Tax Brief (2023); Minnesota Statute § 297B.02

### 4.3 Local Vehicle Excise Tax ($20 Fee)

**What It Is:**
A **flat $20 excise tax** (not a percentage) that certain counties and cities in Minnesota impose on motor vehicle sales.

**Legal Authority:**
Cities and counties are authorized to impose this tax under Minnesota Statute § 297B.09 to fund local transportation projects.

**When Collected:**
- Paid at time of vehicle registration/title transfer
- Collected by deputy registrars
- Separate from motor vehicle sales tax

**Jurisdictions:**
Various metro and Greater Minnesota jurisdictions have enacted this tax. Examples include:
- Some metro counties (Hennepin, Ramsey, etc.)
- Greater Minnesota cities with local transportation needs

**Not a Sales Tax:**
This is a **registration fee**, not a sales tax based on vehicle value. A $15,000 vehicle and a $75,000 vehicle both pay $20.

### 4.4 Special Tax Rates for Older/Collector Vehicles

**Older Passenger Automobiles:**
Under Minnesota Statute § 297B.025, certain older passenger automobiles are taxed at a **flat $10** instead of 6.875%.

**Eligibility (for $10 flat tax):**
- Vehicle is at least 10 years old
- Purchase price is less than the average trade-in value for that vehicle
- Determined by motor vehicle registrar using industry valuation guides

**Collector Vehicles & Fire Trucks:**
Under Minnesota Statute § 297B.035, these vehicles are taxed at a **flat $150** instead of 6.875%.

**Collector Vehicle Criteria:**
- At least 20 years old
- Primarily maintained for use in exhibitions, club activities, parades, and other public interest functions
- Used on limited basis (not daily driver)

**Fire Truck Criteria:**
- Used by volunteer firefighting unit
- Antique fire truck maintained for display/ceremonial purposes

**Example:**
```
Without Special Rate:
────────────────────────────────────
2010 Honda Civic (15 years old)
Purchase Price:        $4,000
Standard Tax @ 6.875%: $  275

With Special Rate (if qualified):
────────────────────────────────────
Flat Tax:              $   10
Savings:               $  265
```

**Source:** Minnesota Statute § 297B.025, § 297B.035

### 4.5 Tax Treatment of Electric Vehicles (EVs)

**Federal EV Tax Credit Interaction:**
Minnesota's treatment of federal EV tax credits depends on how the credit is applied:

**Point-of-Sale Discount (2024+ IRS Rule):**
- If dealer applies the federal EV credit as an **upfront discount**: Credit reduces the taxable purchase price
- Minnesota treats this as a manufacturer rebate

**Tax Return Credit (Traditional Method):**
- If buyer claims the credit on their federal tax return after purchase: Credit does NOT reduce Minnesota sales tax
- Sales tax calculated on full purchase price

**Example:**
```
Scenario 1: Point-of-Sale Credit
────────────────────────────────────
Vehicle MSRP:              $45,000
Federal EV Credit Applied: -$ 7,500
────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Price:             $37,500
MN Tax @ 6.875%:           $ 2,578.13

Scenario 2: Tax Return Credit
────────────────────────────────────
Vehicle MSRP:              $45,000
Federal EV Credit:         $ 7,500 (claimed later on tax return)
────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Price:             $45,000
MN Tax @ 6.875%:           $ 3,093.75
```

**EV Registration Fees:**
Minnesota imposes **additional registration fees** on electric vehicles to offset lost gas tax revenue. This is separate from sales tax.

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Sales Guide; IRS Notice 2023-16

### 4.6 Dealer-Owned Vehicle Tax

Minnesota has special rules for vehicles titled in a dealer's name for demo/loaner use.

**General Rule:**
When a dealer titles a vehicle in their own name (not inventory), they owe sales tax on the **reasonable rental value** of that vehicle.

**Reasonable Rental Value (RRV):**
Calculated based on:
- Type of vehicle
- Length of time dealer-titled
- Comparable rental rates

Dealers must report and pay sales tax on RRV monthly.

**Exemption:**
Vehicles held strictly as inventory for resale are not subject to this tax.

**Source:** MN Revenue Notice #05-05; Minnesota Statute § 297A.64

- Collect motor vehicle sales tax on retail sales
- Report and remit tax collected
- Claim resale exemption for inventory purchases

**Reporting Frequency:**

**Source:** MN DOR Motor Vehicle Industry Guide; Minnesota Statute § 289A.18

### 5.3 Private Party Sales

**Tax Collection:**
Private party sales (individual to individual) are subject to the same 6.875% motor vehicle sales tax.

**Who Collects Tax:**
- Tax is NOT collected at time of sale (buyer and seller do not exchange tax)
- Tax is paid by the buyer when registering/titling the vehicle at a deputy registrar office

**Valuation:**
For private sales, if the declared purchase price appears unusually low, the deputy registrar may use the **average trade-in value** (per industry valuation guides) as the taxable base.

**Trade-In Credit:**
Private party buyers do NOT receive trade-in credit. Trade-in credit only applies when trading to a licensed dealer.

**Example:**
```
Private Party Sale:
────────────────────────────────────
Agreed Purchase Price:     $18,000
(No trade-in credit available)

Tax Due at Registration:
  $18,000 × 6.875%         $ 1,237.50
  Registration Fees:       $    50.00
  Title Transfer Fee:      $    10.50
  ────────────────────────────────────
  Total Due:               $ 1,298.00

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR TAX-SVC

### 7.1 Calculation Logic

**For Retail Sales:**
```typescript
interface MNRetailTaxCalc {
  vehiclePrice: number;
  accessories: number;          // Taxable
  laborCharges: number;          // Taxable (prep, rustproofing, etc.)
  docFee: number;                // NOT taxable
  tradeInValue: number;          // Full credit
  manufacturerRebate: number;    // Reduces taxable price
  dealerIncentive: number;       // Reduces taxable price
  vscAmount: number;             // NOT taxable
  gapAmount: number;             // NOT taxable

  // Calculate taxable base
  taxablePrice = vehiclePrice
    + accessories
    + laborCharges
    - tradeInValue
    - manufacturerRebate
    - dealerIncentive;

  // State tax (no local sales tax on vehicles)
  stateTax = taxablePrice * 0.06875;

  // Local vehicle excise tax (flat fee)
  localExciseTax = 20.00; // If applicable jurisdiction

  totalTax = stateTax + localExciseTax;
}
```

**For Leases:**
```typescript
interface MNLeaseTaxCalc {
  capCost: number;
  residualValue: number;
  tradeInValue: number;           // Reduces vehicle value
  cashDownPayment: number;        // Does NOT reduce vehicle value for tax
  manufacturerRebate: number;     // Reduces vehicle value
  accessoriesInstalled: number;   // Taxable
  interestCharges: number;        // Taxable (money factor cost)
  acquisitionFee: number;         // NOT taxable
  docFee: number;                 // NOT taxable
  vscAmount: number;              // NOT taxable
  gapAmount: number;              // NOT taxable

  // Calculate taxable lease price
  vehicleValue = capCost - tradeInValue - manufacturerRebate;
  totalLeasePrice = vehicleValue
    - residualValue
    + accessoriesInstalled
    + interestCharges;

  // State + local tax (leases ARE subject to local taxes)
  // Metro area example: 6.875% state + 0.75% transit + local = ~7.875%
  stateTax = totalLeasePrice * 0.06875;
  localTax = totalLeasePrice * 0.01000; // Example, varies by jurisdiction

  totalUpfrontTax = stateTax + localTax;
}
```

### 7.2 Jurisdiction Detection

**Local Tax Rules:**
- **Motor Vehicle Purchases:** No local sales tax (state rate only: 6.875%)
- **Motor Vehicle Leases:** Subject to local sales taxes
- **Local Excise Tax:** $20 flat fee in certain jurisdictions

**Metro Transit Tax Jurisdictions (Leases Only):**
- Anoka County: +0.75%
- Carver County: +0.75%
- Dakota County: +0.75%
- Hennepin County: +0.75%
- Ramsey County: +0.75%
- Scott County: +0.75%
- Washington County: +0.75%

**Implementation:**
```typescript
function getMNSalesTaxRate(
  transactionType: 'purchase' | 'lease',
  county: string
): number {
  const STATE_RATE = 0.06875;

  if (transactionType === 'purchase') {
    return STATE_RATE; // Local sales tax does NOT apply to purchases
  }

  // For leases, add local rates
  const METRO_COUNTIES = [
    'Anoka', 'Carver', 'Dakota', 'Hennepin',
    'Ramsey', 'Scott', 'Washington'
  ];

  const TRANSIT_TAX = 0.0075;
  const localRate = getLocalSalesTaxRate(county); // Lookup local city/county rate

  let totalRate = STATE_RATE + localRate;

  if (METRO_COUNTIES.includes(county)) {
    totalRate += TRANSIT_TAX;
  }

  return totalRate;
}
```

### 7.3 Edge Cases

**1. Negative Equity:**
```typescript
// Do NOT add negative equity to taxable price
const negativeEquity = tradeInPayoff - tradeInValue; // e.g., $10K - $8K = $2K
// Negative equity is rolled into loan, but NOT taxable
taxablePrice = vehiclePrice - tradeInValue; // Use actual trade value, not payoff
```

**2. Multiple Rebates:**
```typescript
// Stack all rebates (no limit)
const totalRebates =
  manufacturerRebate +
  dealerIncentive +
  militaryRebate +
  loyaltyRebate +
  regionalRebate;

taxablePrice = vehiclePrice - totalRebates - tradeInValue;
```

**3. Disability Modifications:**
```typescript
// Separately track disability-related accessories (exempt)
if (accessoryType === 'disability_modification') {
  // Do NOT add to taxable price
} else {
  taxablePrice += accessoryPrice;
}
```

**4. Lease Trade-In with Negative Equity:**
```typescript
// For tax purposes, use actual trade value (not payoff)
// But for payment calculation, roll negative equity into cap cost
const tradeInValue = 8000;
const tradeInPayoff = 12000;
const negativeEquity = 4000;

// Tax calculation:
const vehicleValueForTax = capCost - tradeInValue; // Use $8K

// Payment calculation:
const effectiveCapCost = capCost + negativeEquity; // Add $4K to loan
```

**5. EV Federal Tax Credit:**
```typescript
// Check if credit applied at point of sale
if (evCreditAppliedUpfront) {
  // Treat as manufacturer rebate
  taxablePrice = vehiclePrice - evCreditAmount - otherRebates;
} else {
  // Buyer claims on tax return later - does not reduce MN sales tax
  taxablePrice = vehiclePrice - otherRebates;
}
```

## 10. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Does Minnesota charge sales tax on the trade-in value?**
A: No. Minnesota provides 100% trade-in credit with no cap. Trade-in value is fully deducted from the purchase price before calculating tax.

**Q: Are local sales taxes added to the state rate for vehicle purchases?**
A: No. Motor vehicle **purchases** are exempt from local sales taxes. Only the 6.875% state rate applies. However, motor vehicle **leases** are subject to local sales taxes.

**Q: Is the documentation fee taxable in Minnesota?**
A: No. Doc fees are explicitly excluded from the taxable purchase price.

**Q: Are extended warranties (VSCs) taxable on vehicle sales?**
A: No. Vehicle Service Contracts sold with motor vehicles are not subject to motor vehicle sales tax.

**Q: How is negative equity treated for tax purposes?**
A: Minnesota statutes do not explicitly address negative equity. Based on the definition of "purchase price," negative equity rolled into a loan is likely NOT taxable, as it's not part of the consideration for the new vehicle.

**Q: Do manufacturer rebates reduce the taxable price?**
A: Yes. All manufacturer rebates with a fixed value at time of purchase are deducted from the taxable price.

**Q: How are leases taxed in Minnesota?**
A: Sales tax is calculated **upfront** on the total lease price (sum of all payments plus interest, minus residual, trade-in, and rebates). The upfront tax can be financed into the lease.

**Q: Does a cash down payment on a lease reduce the sales tax?**
A: No. Capitalized cost reductions (cash down) reduce the monthly payment but do NOT reduce the taxable lease price for sales tax purposes.

**Q: Can I get a credit if I paid sales tax in another state?**
A: Yes. Minnesota provides a credit for sales tax paid to another state. If the other state's rate is lower, you pay the difference to Minnesota.

**Q: What is the $20 local vehicle excise tax?**
A: Some Minnesota counties and cities impose a flat $20 excise tax (not a percentage) on vehicle sales. This is collected at registration and is separate from sales tax.
